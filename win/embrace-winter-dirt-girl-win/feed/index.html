But sow of the really good experiences was when we investigated a termite mound and found the roostion rocks of Falcons! Boys lo Ed to learn about the shallow track from the animal ls and we are still poo spotting and trying to match it to the right animal! Great fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Weather does not prevent kids from doing what they want. Kids are kids. They play and they learn while doing so. The best thing for us moms to do is to make sure the kids are protected when they play outdoors. I like your idea of getting a list of things to do in a day. But sometimes we also need to be flexible in our schedules.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My girls do all the same things outside in winter as they do in summer - play on the swings, ride bikes, play in the sandpit, chasings, jumping on the trampoline. Our backyard gets full sun in the middle of the day - so it&#039;s actually better to play outside in winter than it is in summer at our place on a sunny day!
We love dirtgirlworld. My 3-year-old likes to have &#039;dirt girl world hair&#039; with 3 pony tails sticking out of her head!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We love doing outdoor play in winter, but really it is much colder here and you can&#039;t allow them that much time totally outside. M two year old has actually turned blue before and required significant warming up. Instead, sometimes we need t bring the outside in. We collect outside things on a walk and use them for craft, we pull out books that might have petals that were placed in them last year and discuss the spring flowers that will be here soon.

But mainly I love Dirt girl, I love the songs. A little too much.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Anything that involves helping his Dad... I think that involved building a retaining wall and leveling some ground today. All I know is that I have NEVER seen such muddy hands in my entire life!]]></description>
