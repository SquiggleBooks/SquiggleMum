		<description><![CDATA[We have just over an acre and it&#039;s such a wonderland for small kiddies. We have fruit and veg, loads of climbing trees and a ball-obsessed dog for them to play with. Sometimes they&#039;ll play apart but mostly the four of them create their own world together.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our backyard has been a work in progress ever since before I had my kids. Our lack of grass has meant my kids have not really been able to play with conventional backyard toys as much. They love nothing better than making mud pies, carting dirt around in their wheelbarrow and planting seeds in pots then helping them grow. When our yard in finally finished (not long to go now) I am planning to put in a mud kitchen as they will miss their dirt!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mine love playing &#039;rescue&#039; on the fort - maybe someone stuck on the slide needs rescuing with a complicated combo of skipping ropes and hoops... or someone is lost in the bush and needs a hug and a cold drink. The only rule we&#039;ve had to make is that they don&#039;t yell &quot;HELP!&quot; for the neighbourhood to hear - our lovely elderly neighbours rang my doorbell very concerned last year - I think they would have taken down the fence had I not answered!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My 10 year old loves football, although due to an injury with his legs, he is not allowed to play right now. He would spend hours kicking the ball to himself. He has just been allowed to ride his bike for 10 minutes twice a week :)

My 8 year old loves tricks on his scooter. His latest trick is to jump over a mud puddle in our yard... to date he hasn&#039;t fallen in to it.]]></description>
