		<description><![CDATA[We have only been recently introduced into the world of Justine Clarke.  My 2yo has always enjoyed some of my music.  His favourites at the moment are The Ramones Blotzkreig Bop (he just knows &quot;piling in the backseat&quot;), and Dolly partons 9-5 (go figure?) He performs a very heavy metal worthy head mosh to both songs!

Since he has developed an interest in playschool, however, it seems that he is beginning to form a little crush on Justine.  Imagine his surprise when he saw her come on to sing a song (I think it was about cultery?) and playschool wasn&#039;t even on! It made his day :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are all HUGE Justine fans in this house: Mum, Dad and our 2-year old daughter!

It is a bit hard to pick just one favourite song for our daughter - she loves pulling funny faces to &quot;Dancing Face&quot;, creeping a worm up her arm during &quot;Doin&#039; It&quot; and singing &quot;Off to the Library&quot; when we are indeed going to the library! But best of all is when she gets a balloon and pretends it is an umbrella and dances to &quot;It&#039;s Starting to Rain&quot;, including rolling on the floor.

Dad&#039;s favourite song is &quot;The Gumtree Family&quot; - it is on repeat in the car ;)

And my favourite would have to be &quot;Song to make you smile&quot; as our daughter always comes and sits in my lap for a cuddle when this song is on :)

We would LOVE to add her third album to our collection :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This would be absolutely wonderful!!! My daughter loves music and she always beams when we sing the playschool or sesame street theme songs. She also love when we sing a song from Sesame Street, we call it Laundromat, but I don&#039;t think it has a name really but it always makes her stop whatever she is doing and boogie. Who would have thought a song about a washing machine could be so great!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My 6mth old son Banyan and I are new to the fantastic world of Justine Clarke. We dance around the kitchen in the morning singing &quot;Watermelon, Watermelon, I love you love watermelon.....&quot; I must admit that I catch myself humming away to the gumtree family song and the hop hippity hop song during the night time feeds.

We&#039;re hooked!!! Thanks Justine for a fun alternative to the wiggles.]]></description>
