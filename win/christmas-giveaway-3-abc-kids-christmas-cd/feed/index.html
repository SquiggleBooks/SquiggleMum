		<description><![CDATA[I have always loved the quieter ones and can&#039;t decide between &quot;AWay in a Manger&quot; or &quot;Silent Night&quot; as my favourite.

I also can&#039;t go past Peter Coombe&#039;s Christmas album - every year growing up that&#039;s what we played as we set up the tree - and now that&#039;s what we play in my house for my children!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, Aussie Jingle Bells has been a favourite in our household for the past few years.

Cath, &quot;Six white boomers&quot; brings back childhood memories of my Kindy class. We performed it in front of the rest of the school. I was dressed in blue and had to play crash cymbals each time we sang &quot;blazing sun&quot;.

We also sang &quot;The North wind is Tossing the leaves&quot; in our school choir. Definitely a more realistic portrayal of Christmas here :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath - really enjoy your writing!!
As a kid, I remember driving around on a bus with our church choir singing carols - Angels We Have Heard on High stands out, lots of fun harmonies in the Gloria in Excelsis Deo bit :-)
A good Christmas album is always welcome in this house!  Steven Curtis Chapman has had a flogging the last few years ;-P
Merry Christmas to you and your family!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am a closet patsy biscoe fan and always loved the last song on her Christmas Album called Little Toy Trains.  It
sings of boys wishing for trains and drums and talks of Santa coming through the sky and telling little boys to go to bed.
I sing it to my boys to go to sleep on and Mr C was particularly excited this year when he heard the recorded version saying &quot;This is your song Mummy&quot;
I found Patsy on itunes also which certainly made me very happy to find this song.

		<description><![CDATA[Cath, I love the look of your advent calendar! And it looks like you are putting the inside paper up on the ones you&#039;ve done... right?  Great idea! So easy for the kids to see where you are up to.

As for Christmas song, my all time fav is &quot;in excelsis deo&quot;.
