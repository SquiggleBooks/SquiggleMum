		<description><![CDATA[Miss 3 and Mr 1 are very excited to be playing outside again now that the weather has warmed up. They love all parts of the garden. Miss 3 loves the little stones at the moment and Mr 1 is into the dirt and mulch at any change he can get. Play clothes are essential!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My 6 1/2 yr old boy needs to be in the right mood to get grubby outside, but once he&#039;s on a roll, look out. Mud pies galore (complete with grass, my flowers, pebbles, then he comes indoors for sultanas, rice, you name it!)
My little 3 yr old girl is more easily convinced and loves to help me water plants, help with the vege patch and like some of the others I&#039;ve read here - go crazy with craft outside.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My kids love to get grubby in a remarkable variety of ways, the other day they got hold of some stamp pads...luckily they also love getting clean. We have a yellow towel that one of my 2 year olds loves, when we wrap her in it and give her a `hood&#039; with the towel, she looks just like Grubby the caterpillar from dirtgirl world. We have taught her to say `Best stunt ever&#039;. LOL. (yes, we a big fans!)

xxoo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think my girls (18months &amp; almost 6) need some more tips on getting grubby. They dont like to get dirty. Although, they like to tell stories about what they might do one day. Dirtgirl is a good encouragement to get into it! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have a veggie patch that my girlies like to dig in.  I purchased them kids gardening gloves which is so cute &#039;cause they&#039;re way too big!  We plant and water and collect the produce.  The tomatoes are by far the favourite.  Miss H picks them....even when they&#039;re not ripe.  She is learning though.
