		<description><![CDATA[I know it&#039;s too late to enter the comp (i didn&#039;t get a chance to enter sooner) but i&#039;m still going to write what my hopes are for my family in 2010.

My family has been struggling for a long time and i&#039;m hoping that this year we will get it together and have a chance to enjoy our family and life. I&#039;d like 2010 to be the year that we get organised and on top of things and resolve our conflicts.... so that we can enjoy 2010 :)

thanks
Bron :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope I can be blessed with a child this year, to add to my family of husband, homestay student and dogs.  Especially after losing both my parents in the last 3 years and being married over 10 years.

Good health would be fantastic and hope I can be encouraging and supportive to others as well.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope 2010 for my family involves:

A safe and healthy arrival of our third baby (to come up with a name would be great too)

My daughter settling into kinder and overcoming her own health obstacles

Quality time together as a family

That is truly all I need to keep a smile on my face!
