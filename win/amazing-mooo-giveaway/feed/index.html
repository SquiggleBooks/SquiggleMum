		<description><![CDATA[I would definately get a set of name labels for each of my 5 children.  They would love them and it&#039;s a great way to personalise their things to prevent the inevitable disagreements that occur regarding ownership!
Thanks for a great giveaway Mooo!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ooooh, got in just in time, just read this post on 30 Jan and have been meaning to check out the Mooo site for a while, so this was the perfect excuse.  What gorgeous things and who doesn&#039;t love seeing their children&#039;s name on something after all those hours of pouring through the books during pregnancy to decide on a name!

If I was to win, I think I would go for some name labels.  My 2nd daughter, Isabella (7mths), is due to start daycare soon as I will be going back to work.  She is inheriting most of her older sister&#039;s (Sophia) clothes as the girls are almost exactly 2 years apart.

As she doesn&#039;t have so many new clothes herself, it would be nice if she could at least have her own pretty personalised labels to cover up the &quot;Sophia&quot; written on all the tags!!]]></description>
