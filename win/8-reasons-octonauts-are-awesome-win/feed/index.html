		<description><![CDATA[My son LOVES the &quot;Oct-it&#039;s&quot;, as he calls it and can tell you all about Dashi, Captain Barnacles, Kwazii and Peso and immediately goes to watch, when he hears it come on.
I love he is so captured by a show with the tagline Explore, Rescue, Protect!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Octonauts- we love you. From the moment we wake, happily singing the song, to wondering what Peso would do, or what Captain Barnacles thinks... We&#039;ve even downloaded the theme song as a ring tone! Go the octonauts!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My kids absolutely LOVE this show - it is their favourite by far (ages 6, 4 &amp; 2). I like the way it captures their imagination and gets their own ideas going - like the other day I found them playing a spinoff of the Octonauts called &quot;Octomoons&quot; (made up by them) - their trampoline was the moon, they would moonwalk over to our ramp where there were 2 mattresses they used as their rocket ships and they had awesome adventures just like the Octonauts - rescuing, exploring and having fun! My 4 year old son is always telling me the latest Octonaut plot and I love hearing him get excited. :)]]></description>
