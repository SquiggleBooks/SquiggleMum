		<description><![CDATA[My kids love the Hi-5 song &quot;Come around to my place&quot;. While I agree it&#039;s hard to be as fond of the new Hi-5ers, I&#039;m coming around to them! Our number 3 is only three days old, so I guess I have a few more years of Hi-5 in front of me!!! The song we sing the most though is Justine Clarke&#039;s &quot;Off to the Library&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[Current fav for nephews is The Rainbow Connection.  I love that they love this song because even now it&#039;s one of my all time favourites too and it&#039;s on the special CD I made for them.  I love this song for little boys especially

&quot;Have you been half asleep
and have you heard voices?
I&#039;ve heard them calling my name.
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same.
I&#039;ve heard it too many times to ignore it.
It&#039;s something that I&#039;m supposed to be.
Someday we&#039;ll find it, the rainbow connection,
the lovers, the dreamers and me&quot;]]></description>
