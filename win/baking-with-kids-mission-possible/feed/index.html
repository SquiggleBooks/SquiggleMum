		<description><![CDATA[Goodness, my kids love anything that involves licking the beaters, the spoon and the bowl. They don&#039;t really care too much what it is, so long as it&#039;s sweet, sticky and can be iced. LOL]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We love to bake, but often run out of mixture before we get it into any baking tin.... after the mixing and mess, then licking fingers, spoons, beaters and bowls... there isn&#039;t much left to bake, Hehehe. When Miss 2 yrs, Mr 4 yrs and I do cook together we make choc chip biscuits, cupcakes and usually a date loaf for Grandad. I love this Baking pack, especially the colourful rolling pins. Cooking is so much fun with kids and the learning that takes place is priceless, so too are the messy faces at the end.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh wow what a fantastic kit!! =)

My girls (5 &amp; 3) love helping me with biscuits... eating the dough and decorating mainly! The end results always look rather interesting but they&#039;re always delicious and &#039;sprinkled with love&#039; as they say! Master 1 likes to watch and lick a beater!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have recently found your website and love having a read.
I am a Family Day Care Educator and include cooking within my program.
One of our favourites (that most children love) is making playdough as you do not always have to eat what you create.
We also love healthy muesli slice, honey joys, fruit pops, pizza circles,biscuits, fried rice, bruschetta (made with tomatoes and basil we grew) and lately whoopie cakes!

Being an educator i always try to cook healthy and balanced food (with the occassional unhealthy) with the children in my care but can be tricky due to the allergies and conditions some of the children have.

We are always after new and great recipes to use and then to share with all of the other carers within my scheme.

Some carers find it difficult and nerve wrecking to cook with children in their care due to all of the precautions and hazards we need to indentify and also ensure saftey and hygeiene. So it would be great to receive a kit to share with others or as a &quot;cooking box&quot; that can be borrowed by carers within the scheme to make it easier for them and a fun stress free experience for all.

It is amazing how many children actually have never cooked within their own home or with family and their first experience can be when they are in care.

I know my parents thank me beacuse they cannot be bothered and cant believe i cook with so many children at once and they dont with just one, and to me that is really sad. So to have the experience with them is a  beautiful memory.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a miss 9 and a miss 11 and they LOVE to bake!  Our most favourite would have to be cupcakes.  Who doesn&#039;t enjoy licking the beaters and bowl after all that hard work.  Other favourites include good old fashioned jam drop biscuits, sultana/cornflake cookies and Anzac bikkies too. Desert recipies of apple crumbles, bread and butter puddings and trifles have also been created.  Now if I can just get the girls to help peel those veges!! Somehow baking is way more fun :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a great looking kit.

Today Miss 4, Mr 2 and I cooked muffins for the first time. They worked out well and the kids are currently eating them.
Miss 4 is allergic to eggs and dairy so it is always good to add a successful recipe to our &#039;safe and tasty&#039; collection.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son and I recently discovered the joy of making our own pizzas.  Who would have thought it was so easy and my son(3 hrs) loves to rub the. Utter into the flour, need the dough and most especially roll out the bases.  Toppings are really just the final excitement - everything needs olives!!  Love to let him loose with that orange rolling pin!]]></description>
