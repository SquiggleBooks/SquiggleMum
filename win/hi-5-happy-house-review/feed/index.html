		<description><![CDATA[Our house is a very happy house at the moment. We welcomed a beautiful little girl into our family 2 weeks ago. Caitlin was only 5 pound when she was born so she&#039;s a bit on the tiny side. She has brought si much joy to Mummy &amp; Daddy and big sister Grace. I&#039;m sure Grace would love a copy of hi 5&#039;s new dvd. She us a big fan already and was thrilled to see them at rhymes festival last week.]]></description>
