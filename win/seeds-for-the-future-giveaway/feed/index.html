		<description><![CDATA[Oh I think this is a fab fund-raising idea. Our school has quite a popular gardening club and has just built a brand new perma-culture garden system for the chooks and part of the veggie garden so this could be right up their alley! Will have to pass on the details!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Catherine,

What a lovely idea for a school fundraiser.  Could you please ask Lily to save a pack of seeds for me.  Now that the wet season is nearly over it is a lovely time to begin planting in my herb and vege garden again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I  love gardening and we have a vegie patch in our backyard. My 3 year old son also loves to see plants growing from seeds. He takes lots of interest in sowing the seeds with me.He loves to water them with his little hands.I  am always happy to see the excietment on his face when new plants come out.This year we had a Zucchini plant in our backyard and my son use to water it in the evening and was very happy to see the zucchini growing on the plant.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have just started my garden this year with my kids and am loving sharing the experience with them.  My boys love picking the snake beans and tomatoes.  My two year old is starting to understand what red means now and doesn&#039;t pick too many green ones.  They each have a wheelbarrow and they share a tractor so it is a very fun time gathering the produce.

When they lose interest, I find it helps that our play cafe/kitchen is nearby so I can keep weeding while eating &#039;pancakes&#039; that are delivered from the cafe.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have a pot garden and love it!  Easy maintenance, easy reach and easy re-plant to keep us (and sometimes our neighbours) in supply.  We also have a mushroom box which seems to delight the little monsters, a passionfruit vine that doubles as a cubby roof and a herb patch that seems more out of control than anything - it smells lovely as we brush past walking along the paths though!]]></description>
