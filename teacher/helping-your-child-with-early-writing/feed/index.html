		<description><![CDATA[I said bread, milk,watermelon and butter. Two out four is good right !
This advice is good for even when they get older. I say to my seven year old now when he struggles with a word
&quot;Sound the word out.&quot;
Then when he has the sounds he writes it down and we go back and correct each part.

Thanks for your post.]]></description>
