		<description><![CDATA[Dear Cath,
Just a small personal message of thanks for your kind words. The Poppy has been a long labour of love in every aspect of its creation, and it is lovely to find a review that understands what I was trying to say so well.
Many thanks again,
Best wishes,
Andrew.]]></description>
