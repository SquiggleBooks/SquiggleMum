		<description><![CDATA[Oh yes, my girls love ribbon sticks. My Mum gave them ones with long rainbow streamers that she bought for $2 from the local jumble shop and they lasted 6 months before the dogs chewed them up. We made our own after that from craft box scraps and old bits of dowling. A hugely fun activity!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love ribbons, I collect them from presents and cutting the little strap you get on shirts when you hang them on a coat hanger... they may be thin, but put a bunch together and you have a great ribbon stick. Another great post SquiggleMum.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@amandab

We didn&#039;t spend a cent on ours Amanda.  All ribbons used here are old ones from the busy-box. You could use strips of fabric, wool, or even paper.  We happened to have the dowel on hand left over from something else, but if not I would have just used sticks from the backyard!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These look so fun! We&#039;ve never done ribbon sticks, but my kids love running outdoors with sheer fabric pieces... they can be capes, they can be wings, magic carpets, shields ... you can drape them over your head to spy on the birds (!). I love simple, Waldorf-esque &quot;toys&quot;... what a gift to give your kids - imaginative play :)]]></description>
