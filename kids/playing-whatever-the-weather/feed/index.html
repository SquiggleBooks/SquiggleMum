		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ll never forget visiting a child care centre in Norway - the four year olds pulled on their winter woolies and wellies and trapsed outside for their daily walk into the nearby forest, even though it was FREEZING cold and drizzling. The babies slept in cots in a room that was kind of outside - opening in the walls let fresh air in. Just amazing. Whenever I think &quot;it&#039;s too cold to play&quot; I think of Norway and remind myself to think differently.

		<description><![CDATA[My 13yr old thinks 10 degrees C is hot!

His first few years of life were in a tiny Highland village &quot;Achnasheen&quot; which is Gaelic for &quot;Field of Storms&quot;. The weather there was severe but we always tried to get outside daily.

Interestingly as a teacher, I rarely had a wet break there - but sometimes the midgies were so bad that we couldn&#039;t go outside!!!

		<description><![CDATA[I tend to stay out of extremes of weather, and my children ( one grown up now) do the same. But I do like a run/walk/ramble in the hills on chilly days, if it is not raining.

Your post has given me food for thought]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve been in the middle of extreme heat the past few weeks and it&#039;s been killing me.  We&#039;ve been hitting the kid gym on a regular basis for some run time, but it&#039;s just not the same as getting out.

Thanks for stopping by my blog!

		<description><![CDATA[Something to bear in mind once we have a garden, although it is usual wind that sends us indoors over temperature. Princess and I were discussing spending more time outside when the sunny days come back, but perhaps we will think about the not so sunny days too :)

		<description><![CDATA[Outside play time is an absolute necessity at our house. The only days we don&#039;t go out are when it&#039;s absolutely pouring rain for the 3rd day in a row or so and Mom&#039;s done with changing clothes on little bodies for the day. Some days like this I&#039;ll let the kids go out in their jammies (with a raincoat of course) if I know I&#039;m going to wash those jammies anyway...saves one clothing change. Feels strange, but it works for us!

		<description><![CDATA[I have an issue with the clothes - my kids don&#039;t wear them!  I always wonder whether to let them go and trust they will put something on, or if they genuinely don&#039;t realise they will feel better with a jumper.  I know they won&#039;t get sick from it, it&#039;s about the enjoyment factor.

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Catherine. We too are great believers in getting children outside in the natural elements. Providing children with layers of clothing means they can strip down or rug up as they feel the need ... and trust your child they WILL know if they are hot or cold!
