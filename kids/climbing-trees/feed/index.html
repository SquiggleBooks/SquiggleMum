		<description><![CDATA[As a children we could climb any tree we wanted to, except poplars (brittle) and as high as we wished.  We never fell.  We&#039;d climb macrocarpas over 200 feet high. Our cousins (children of teachers) looked on with huge envy.  It gave us a command of the environment and a lofty view of the outdoors.  Our own kids had the same freedom.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Annie was the first child in her 4 year old kinder class who climbed the big tree in the yard. Didn&#039;t take long for the other children to figure out how to do it. The teachers had a strict set of rules, only one child in the tree at a time, they couldn&#039;t use things to help them climb it, if they needed a boost another child had to provide it. More often than not Annie is up a tree when we go out to the park.

Heidi&#039;s kinder had a fallen tree that the children could climb over but no trees to climb up.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When I started to think about this I have quite a connection to climbing trees.  Peter even hung from one in his Wedding suit to kiss me on our Wedding day and we have the photos too. I climbed many a tree as a child and particularly remember playing tiggy in the trees at Cottontree Caravan Park at Mooloolaba, Cranky old people would chase us out of them but we would always be back within 5 minutes of them walking away.  Must look at where else in the garden we can plant some trees.
