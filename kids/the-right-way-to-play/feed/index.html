		<description><![CDATA[I stand at one of the crumbling windows in our renovator&#039;s delight and despair as I look at the mangle and tangle of passionfruit vine, wisteria and spikey, spikey bouganvillea that invades our garden.  Weekends and weekends of work ahead (big sigh). As I turn with another huge sigh, I suddenly spy my two youngest children engrossed in the most wonderful game of camping out.  They have assembled a circle of rocks (so the first doesn&#039;t escape) and piled the middle high with kindwing and logs. So very proud of their campfire. Yes you are so right about the sheer wonderfulness of imaginative play.  We must all be sure to never stifle their ability to create and dream.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a boy, my bicycle spent as much time upside down as right side up. I liked to turn the peddles by hand and pretend I was churning ice cream. I made my mom &quot;buy&quot; a lot of it.

Last night, I was talking to a group that included several families new to our community so I got to use my best line about the &quot;right&quot; way to play: &quot;If your kid doesn&#039;t come home covered in paint, mud, water, snot, and maybe even blood, he&#039;s not doing it right. And that goes for you too!&quot;

		<description><![CDATA[I wonder ... do children in child care centres get to play with boxes and upside down wheelbarrows? I see a lot of expensive purpose-built toys (eg cubbies) ... and can&#039;t help wondering if they miss out on this imaginative play??

		<description><![CDATA[Wheelbarrows and boxes are great but growing up our favorite outside imagination tools were two saw horses. You could add sheets to them, tree branches or card board boxes. You name it we did it. We had no air conditioning so from sun-up to sun-down we were outside creating and playing with those two saw horses.
