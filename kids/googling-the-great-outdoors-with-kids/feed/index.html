It&#039;s a great bug catcher! Folds down into a little pocket too so wonderful for taking out places.  It was the grand sum of about $5 from the MTA clearance place (Toy Outlet) at Brendale ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hehehe Cath - Jack told me all about Lily&#039;s caterpillar that was going to turn into a Hawk Moth while he was having a bath tonight!  I hadn&#039;t read your blog yet so found it quite funny to see that Jack really did listen to Lily about her caterpillar!  Thanks for sharing - Jack obviously was very interested in the caterpillar as it made it to the &#039;news&#039; from his day at Kindy - boys are such hard work to get much info out of them about what happens at Kindy - so it must really have spiked Jack&#039;s interest for him to tell us about it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a fabulous use of technology!  My oldest is obsessed with snails and we&#039;ve been watching You Tube videos of the giant snails that can be as big as a persons forearm.  Freaky but she loves it.

Last year we got a home reader from school about world dances.  After we read it we looked up each of the types of dance on YouTube.  It made the whole experience much more fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This isn&#039;t even *just* for the littlies - a friend of mine (who is still amazed by what google can do) and I were recently in the park &amp; found a tree with little red berries on it. Neither of us was quite sure what they were (but at 31yo, she&#039;d already eaten an unknown berry! Maybe I&#039;m too careful, but I wouldn&#039;t eat it until I knew what it was) so we googled it - the result? Mulberries - I&#039;d never seen them before.. I &lt;3 google!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We used Google regularly in my child care centre to find information related to all sorts of topics which the children were interested in.  What would we do without the wonders of Google?  Go to the library and look in the encyclopedia I guess, which is a little more difficult with a group of small children.
