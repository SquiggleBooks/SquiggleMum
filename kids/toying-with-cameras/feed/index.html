		<description><![CDATA[Yes!  My girls love the camera.  We are lucky enough to have a tripod as well, which makes it even better.  It protects the camera a bit - they can&#039;t drop it or bang it into anything - but it also lets them set shots up and hold them steady.

		<description><![CDATA[I think it is a great idea!  My son (5) at the time was showing interest in my camera, so i pulled out the old film camera.  we brought new batteries and a film.  He learnt that he had to think about the photos he wanted to take as he had limited film, and was so excited to see his final products when they were printed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Miss 3 uses our digital camera to take photos indoors and out. She often spends ages wondering around taking photos of her surroundings and people. After each sessions we load them onto the computer for a look. It almost tells a story of what she was doing and her learning of the process - one with head missing, then feet missing then a whole person,
Our kids will grow up with amazing IT skills and take them for granted as an essential part of life. How exciting!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We bought our daughter a digital camera when she was about 9 or 10. Like you we first looked at &quot;toy&quot; cameras but for the same money, ended up getting her a &quot;proper&quot; one which she is still using (she&#039;s now 13). And boy is it ever getting a workout! This is the Facebook generation, she takes heaps of photos every day and uploads them. Back in my day (gee that makes me sound old!) we used to hide from the camera, not this lot, they love practising all their smiles, pouts, and poses and then posting them for all to see!!!! (Don&#039;t worry we&#039;ve made sure that the privacy settings are on ...)
