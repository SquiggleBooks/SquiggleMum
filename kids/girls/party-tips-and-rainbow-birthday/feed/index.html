		<description><![CDATA[Bookmarking this one!  My little (big boy) man is almost 3.  Last year I had promised him a party for his third birthday and I&#039;ve been collecting bits and bobs for it for a while now.  With number 2 due on Brian&#039;s birthday it has taken a back seat, but now Simon is here I had best get back to it!  Have been thinking of ideas to keep the little party guests entertained - thank you for the tips.

My biggest dilemma is the cake.  I want a 3D Thomas cake with butter cream icing, but have NO IDEA how to do the face!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Looks like she had a wonderful time.
My only addition to invitation etiquette is to not give out the invitations at school UNLESS you are inviting the whole class.
I also like having a theme to tailor the games/activities etc to the theme.  EG for a princess theme you can &quot;pass the crown&quot; or some other royal item and they get to choose an item out of a bag every time music stops - saves you wrapping and wrapping!  Internet gives lots of ideas these days.  Decorating cupcakes is a favourite of mine too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Make the cake a few days ahead and freeze it straight out of the oven,  it keeps it moist.  Take it out the day before and decorate,  place in fridge and presto the next day it is ready and soooo very yummy.  (insiders secret ;) )     Parties after school from 3:30 for 1.5 hours are great.  we have been to a few and they were all so hassle free.  A cake and some popcorn   kids played  parents had coffee.  I loved it.  but being sick this year I opted for Hungry Jacks.  But rather than leaving it to the 15 year old I sent out with the invites a little tick card for the option  cheese or plain burger  what drink etc.   I tallied it up and presto the day went with out a hitch.]]></description>
