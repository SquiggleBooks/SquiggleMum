		<description><![CDATA[Hi

I was wondering where you got the skirt from, my daughter had exactly the same and really loved it but last week she ripped it while she was out.

Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[Cath, another great post. There were a lot of wonderful lessons learnt there. The post struck a particular chord with me though because we too have a rainbow skirt. I&#039;ve experienced first hand the joy it can bring and my daughter is still squeezing into her size 4 skirt at age 6. I don&#039;t think we&#039;ll ever get rid of it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for sharing this story :) It&#039;s a beautiful skirt :) and some very important lessons were learned on both sides :)

i have a girl among 3 boys and we have a beautiful skirt put aside for my daughters 7th birthday (end of february)... we have had this skirt put aside since before xmas and it&#039;s pretty and frilly and everything that my daughter loves in clothing. She&#039;s seen a pic of it and would love it but as tempted as i am to give it to her i have held on to it .... it&#039;s been hard not to just give it to her but i want her to treasure the skirt and the memories that will go with it....

thank you again for sharing :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have that skirt.... times 2!

My girls have been in love with since they saw a friend wearing it about two years ago. When I saw them in Myers (about the same time as you I think) I had to buy them as a special surprise. Totally impractical but so loved... and I always remember that the clothes I love the most are the ones I wear the most and therefore practical or not, value for money!

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for that Cath.  I&#039;m sure there are now left now.  Also a lesson I think Ella needs to learn.  She certainly doesn&#039;t understand that you can&#039;t always have everything that you want straight away.]]></description>
