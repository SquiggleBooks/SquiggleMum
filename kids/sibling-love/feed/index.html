		<description><![CDATA[Well, you know us... As kids we had our ups &amp; downs for sure! (You were there for some of those). As adults we get along well when we&#039;re together, but that&#039;s not that often. (He&#039;s terrible at returning phone calls &amp; keeping in touch just for the sake of it, but that seems to be not that uncommon).

I don&#039;t know what the secret is.. I&#039;m not even sure there is a secret.

For us as army kids, we moved around a bit too. Maybe that had a bit to do with it - one constant, we were both in it together?

We both also went to scouts, but had different friendship groups within that group so we were experiencing the same things but from a different perspective. And we took family holidays up until I was 14, so I guess by default we spent quite a bit of time together. Having said that, we also spent quite a bit of time apart - different sports, friendship groups and interests. We weren&#039;t always besties, but after that teenage period where you&#039;re too busy trying to understand yourself, it&#039;s a LOT easier!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am friends with my adult brother.  My brother and I were close growing up probably partly because we moved quite regularly, he was the only one who had shared some of the same experiences (not many others I could have played removalists with).  We stayed close during the teenage years possibly because we had many of the same friends and still do for that matter.

I think that doing things together as a family is one key.  Mum, Dad, my brother and I holidayed together even when we were teenagers.  At the time I can remember sometimes being envious of friends who didn&#039;t do as many things as a family but mostly I liked having a close family.  My brother and I have even holidayed together since we have both been married.

Sometimes I think I would be closer to a sister than my brother and at times I have really wished I had a sister, not that I would not want my brother.  I just think sisters can have a very special bond.  I also have a daughter and a son and struggled with not having more children so my 2 might have a sibling of the same gender.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am the youngest of 5 and have 5 sons of my own. I am close to my 2 sisters and while I don&#039;t see my 2 brothers often we get along well when we get together.
As for my own children we have always tried to make them remember that they belong to the &quot;Taylors&quot;. Family comes first and as a &quot;Taylor&quot; you have a repsonsiblity to your family. Family will still be there long after friends have moved on.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I can&#039;t stand my sister, we&#039;ve never gotten on.  I think a lot of it is personality, I was also the odd one out while she and my brother played together.
My two currently adore each other and I really hope it continues.  We&#039;re like you - always jump on anything good and comment on it.  We also try to give them both one on one time, because I think too much togetherness could be counter-productive.

		<description><![CDATA[was just having this conversation with husband last night wondering if our two would be friends as they grew up through teens and into adulthood or would gender get in the way? Like you we have a girl then a boy and they are about 2 years apart. Will be interesting to watch. Hope they will be good friends/there for each other (and do all we can to foster this now) but maybe another thing is hoping that they both find partners that also get on with each others sib. If you can&#039;t have a sister/brother then at least an in-law would be nice in adulthood. Love being an Aunty too]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We made a conscious decision to keep Miss M (now 3.9) at home rather than putting her in pre-prep. She can attend next year when she is four.  It was just so much more important for us to encourage a good friendship/sibling relationship between our two girls before their years of schooling when they will spend much of their time apart.  They have a great time together now and think the world of each other.  I hope and pray this continues : )

		<description><![CDATA[I would say my brother and I are close. We were really close as kids (which probably comes from being the only kids that both spoke english while we were growing up).

Things changed when we were a little older - we have really differnt interests so probably wouldn&#039;t be friends if we weren&#039;t siblings. But becasue of our shared history I think we&#039;ll always be close (I hope so, anyway)

		<description><![CDATA[Oh interesting question on sibling rivalry....

I have an older brother who tortured me as a child and as adults we are not at all close.

My girls are closer than close, in a way I (not being a twin) will never understand... yet they still compete and fight and dislike things about each other. So I kind of think that stuff must be somewhat normal in any sibling relationship?

Perhaps the key is helping our kids build a relationship where they can disagree and fight and still know they will be loved and cherished by their siblings???
