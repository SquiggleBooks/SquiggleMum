		<description><![CDATA[My Son (now 3) ADORES birds of all kinds - at the moment his favourite is also the Rainbow Lorikeet. He carried our copy of Simpson and Day&#039;s book of Australian Birds everywhere for at least a year (and I mean EVERYWHERE). It is now in dire need of re-binding! The words: &#039;Butcherbird, Magpie, Currawong&#039; will be forever etched in my mind as memories of the page order of this book and also of my little one and his love of the natural world around him.
