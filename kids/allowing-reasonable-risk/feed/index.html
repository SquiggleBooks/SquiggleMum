		<description><![CDATA[Good to read your post, and the comments - have you noticed how little adult interaction (as well as child interest and engagement) happens in a &quot;safe as possible&quot; environment? When a child is using real tools it requires adult involvement, coaching, monitoring, supervising of the child at work...so much learning and sharing...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sometimes it&#039;s best to not look; that&#039;s what I tell myself when any of my children try to master the art of skateboarding, climbing the big tree, trying to do forward flips.

Love &amp; stuff

		<description><![CDATA[Such a thought provoking post. I&#039;m in both camps I guess! I get funny looks for letting Will play with my scissors, but he knows how to use them, and the other ones don&#039;t cut! Then at other times I think he&#039;s too little or I&#039;m too scared. I&#039;ll be thinking of the chopping boy then!

		<description><![CDATA[My son has helped in the kitchen since he could stand. I was amazed at how easily he understood and remembered which things were hot and could not be touched. He would very carefully stir pots, chop softer veggies (or play dough if he wanted to keep going), always with supervision to be sure he stayed safe, but he really didn&#039;t need much. He is 4 now and has never gotten hurt plus he loves cooking!

Knowing that he is capable of this and enjoys so much being a part of this daily activity,  makes plastic food toys seem really silly (at least for our housefhold).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cath sometimes I think we almost need permission from other adults/peers to feel it is okay to offer children &#039;dangerous&#039; objects to &#039;play&#039; with. For example we toyed with the hot glue gun idea all year but when Tom continued to put them into the hands of his children, some as young as two we figured if he was doing it safely we could too. Now the children are keen to get them out to &#039;play&#039; and they LOVE it! This year our kinder children have used hammers and nails, electric drill, iron, lighted candles, hot glue gun, diluted bleach, adult scissors and the hand saw resulting in one finger burn from the iron, one finger burn from the hot glue gun and fifty four very happy and more knowledgeable children!

		<description><![CDATA[I love the idea of &#039;as safe as necessary, not as safe as possible&#039;. I&#039;m loosening up with my boys, trying to allow more risk. I close my eyes as Mr6 swooshes down the ramp at the skate park on his scooter - rather than shouting &#039;NOOOOO&#039;. So far, so good.

		<description><![CDATA[Great post - I think a certain amount of risk taking is essential for all children. As they grow they learn how to deal with a variety of situations and then can develop the skills to make their own risk assesment! My son is incredibly creative and forever has a pair of adult scissors in his hands whilst making his latest artistic work of art. His younger sister wants to do whatever he is doing, and like you there are discussions about sensible use of scissors or climbing trees or whatever else it may be that they are doing that has potential dangers. If they are allowed to take a few risks now maybe this will be good practice for taking some amazing risks when they are adults (in work, in travel, etc...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. Injuries are part of learning. The amount of scars my kids have are a reminder of their risk taking adventures-from climbing trees to no hands on their bikes. Just last week, Samuel, my youngest, helped me prepare wood samples for my nature class. He had to hand saw the wood into strips then drill a hole in each disk with an electric drill. He was thrilled to be allowed the opportunity to help and did an amazing job.
Thanks for a great post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I grew up with a fear of doing many things so to encourage a less fearful nature in my kids I&#039;ve allowed them to give most things a go. Both my girls love to use real scissors, they enjoy climbing and love to use knives when helping in the kitchen.  I&#039;m really keen to try using the glue gun and hammers with the girls when I set up a spot for them. (Did you see Jamie&#039;s Food Revolution the night the kids were given knives to eat their food.  The kitchen cooks wouldn&#039;t allow primary school kids to eat with knives.  Crazy!)

You&#039;ve listed a great lot of blogs Cath.  They challenge me to take my girls fun + learning that step further.  Great post!
