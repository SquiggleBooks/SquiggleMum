		<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for those incredible ideas. finding things to do with children is so hard sometimes, especially during the winter break when they are home ALL THE TIME! Their most recent favourite is to make random sandwich crafts out of bread and salad bits, not sure how to explain it I found at this &lt;a href=&quot;http://recipes-for-kids.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;recipes for kids&lt;/A&gt; site here, the&#039;res a little picture with each one which is great. Thought your readers might like to try that too. Well, I must be back to rea life now, either my kids are calling or I&#039;m imagining things, which is also quite possible.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I must try the pasta with playdough, as playdough seems to be our activity of choice at the moment.

And yes, I always have to be careful about what I say about pictures too, firstly making sure I am holding it up the right way LOL]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love your ideas.  We used to get out the cooking play set, a big plastic mat and various types of uncooked pasta and rice.  The children used to have loads of fun playing cooking.

Sometimes I would cook up the pasta, take it outside with the cooking playset.  They&#039;d have great fun playing with it (eating some of it of course!) and would usually end up in a spaghetti throwing fight.]]></description>
