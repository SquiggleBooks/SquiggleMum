		<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful party for you boy and bears. I love parties like this, they are simply the best. My nephew had one at a park on the beach recently ... snags in bread, pass the parcel, sack races, three-legged races etc ... everyone had fun, and it was proof you don&#039;t have to spend a lot of money to have a great, memorable party. Beats those fancy schmancy ones any day!

		<description><![CDATA[What a delightful party Cath! Good on you for doing it all yourself ... CAKE INCLUDED! I totally agree a birthday party should reflect and celebrate the child&#039;s personality. It doesn&#039;t happen enough these days.
