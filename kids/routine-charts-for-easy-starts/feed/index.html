		<description><![CDATA[This would be really helpful around our house, particularly now Princess Ella has started kindergarten. Mornings have been a tad chaotic the last two weeks!
Will check out the other resources too. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a BIG fan of routine charts. We NEED them to get out the house in the mornings. We usually allow the kids to &#039;reward&#039; themselves with something if they finish early (as per what you mentioned to Alison). It works really well. And if they want something for a longer period of time they can add it up for the weekend. Ours are wipeable and very cute.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cathie, I couln&#039;t agree more..we just started a routine chart last week, and it is soooo helpful, no more nagging and we are ready well ahead of schedule in the mornings.  I felt I had to attach a reward to the chart (maybe a mistake, after reading your points above), he gets a sticker at the end of each day and then a reward at the end of the week (nothing too big though), but for the time being, his behaviour is improving because he is being more compliant and is also busier.:)Sam]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Alison. What about an incentive? Make it clear what time you&#039;re leaving (it&#039;s 8am for us) and then if he&#039;s ready BEFORE leaving time, he can use that time to..... play on the iPad? Something else that tickles his fancy??]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Suggestions for non-competitive kids? I have a 5-yr-old who doesn&#039;t care about record time, about doing it faster than yesterday, or his brother, or...much else really. Then he gets cranky when it&#039;s time to go and i start going out to the car and he&#039;s not dressed...as if that&#039;s my fault! I hate making him cranky, and i don&#039;t do it intentionally but some days it&#039;s *the only thing* that gets him to do what he&#039;s sposed to do...]]></description>
