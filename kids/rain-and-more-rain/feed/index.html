		<description><![CDATA[We all love the kid&#039;s bunk bed. The underside doubles as a monkey bar (with a nice soft landing pad), a few blankies off Mum and Dad&#039;s bed make it into a beaut cubby house and spot-lighting location (torches and shadow puppets are a must) and we have even made the walls into an art gallery, showcasing all the art and craft the kids have produced during our &#039;inside time&#039;!

		<description><![CDATA[This rain has been crazy...it&#039;s been going and going and going and going....

The girls and I have been doing lots of train play too but we have also enjoyed puppet shows (love my old resources!!), making up concerts, art (drawing, cutting, glueing), board games, reading and playing libraries.

Hoping for some dry weather this week so we can enjoy the outdoors again.  Love the rain though.  Thank you God!

		<description><![CDATA[I love their buildings and the cubby. Here&#039;s what we did on a few rainy days last year (considering Perth has had a 3 month drought I can&#039;t show anything recent!).

1. Cooked playdough for the toys - http://blogs.oddsocks.net/ahunt/2009/07/09/what-to-do-on-a-rainy-day-part-1/

2. Installed an elevator in our house - http://blogs.oddsocks.net/ahunt/2009/07/12/what-to-do-on-a-rainy-day-part-2/

		<description><![CDATA[being the insane mum that I am,  we have a small bike, coupe car and slide inside.  I have a string line up with balls hanging down from it to hit with tennis rackets, books books books and more books, tv, online games, heaps of fun cooking and easter craft.  The trampoline is great as it dries pretty quick between showers,  we also play under the patio.  The only thing we dont really do is go on a bike ride or the swings.  In the rain its life as usual.   I set Zoe up with the wii fit to burn off some energy  she loves yoga, step class and jogging.  Oh and the hula hoop option is great.  Anyone not yet got a wii fit pack  grab one now!]]></description>
