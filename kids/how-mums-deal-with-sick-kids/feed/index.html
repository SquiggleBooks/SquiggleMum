		<description><![CDATA[My boy recently had surgery and they only allow one parent to stay overnight at the hospital so we didn&#039;t have much of a choice since he was being exclusively breast fed, I would have to stay with him. Hourly neuro obs are a pain in the behind for a anyone but for a three month old who you&#039;ve just managed to get to sleep they&#039;re horrible! Because the operation was on his head, he couldn&#039;t put it down on the bed so had to be held for three days. But you do what you gotta do. When we came home my parents came over and minded Tricky while his dad (who had been spending 18 hours a day at the hospital with us) and I just slept! We woke up a few hours later to a clean house and dinner on the table. Couldn&#039;t have done it without them.

		<description><![CDATA[As a single Mum, it&#039;s hard when they&#039;re sick over night as I have no one to take shifts with. These are the days when often the well child misses a day of school too because Mummy is exhausted! When they&#039;re sick we all have a day off &amp; watch DVDs in bed :)

		<description><![CDATA[Most mothers are sick of their kids getting sick
and when they are gooder Mum’s gladder.
But when my little boy is not good, he’s the bestest –
and when he is better he’s badder!
© Kathryn Apel 2009

This is not so much a statement about his behaviour when he&#039;s well, but rather, how good he is when he&#039;s sick! Such a stoic little man. And he&#039;s home with me today, as I type this. Just one more in a long run of sick days this sememster. :( Sometimes you just get everything that&#039;s going...

As to a tip... For my sanity, I usually find that tossing hubby out of bed and bringing the sick lad in with me works. My sleep is more restful when he&#039;s within reach - and I don&#039;t get vertigo from staggering through the house all through the night.

		<description><![CDATA[We had some very wakeful nights recently with sick kids.  After two nights in a row with minimal sleep, when the two littlest sickies were asleep, I put a DVD on for my daughter.  She rested on one couch and I went to sleep on the other!

		<description><![CDATA[Such a current topic for this household!!  I can&#039;t even begin to count the amount of outings and events we have cancelled over the past 5 or so months that the kids have been tag teaming with sickness.  Some have been even bigger events that I had organised.  It is disappointing but worth it for helping them to get better....and for not spreading the illness to others.  I&#039;m lucky my girls are both still good day sleepers so I use that time to recharge.  During the night, both my husband and I work on helping the girlies when they are sick.

Staying home is so important to helping other families.  Some things that we go to during the week in winter and spring seem to have sick kids everywhere.  Sadly we have had to stay clear of those fun activities to avoid more sickness to our kids : (
