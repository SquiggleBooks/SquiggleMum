		<description><![CDATA[I remember when my children were little I would set them up in bed (Yep! If you&#039;re too sick to go to school you have to stay in bed). I had a breakfast tray which would straddle their legs as they propped on their pillows and I could set everything up on that for them. Actually come to think of it, apart from the sick bit ... sounds like heaven! :)

		<description><![CDATA[I like my kids to rest up as much as possible.  Wish my biggest kid (daddy) would do the same ; ) Lots of lying down stuff happens here when kids are sick but if they&#039;re up to it we do quiet activities too.  Hope your two get better really soon  Cath.

Hope immy gets better too Christie.

PS  Would love to hear more about your views on colouring in sometime.  (Maybe a different blog post) We love to do it here.  I&#039;m keen because it encourages neatness, concentration etc. My girlies love to draw draw draw but colouring in is also a favourite too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are on day two of sick toddler and have had lots of quiet play - trains and dolls have featured a lot - unfortunately  we are largely stuck inside as it is just so hot here at the moment as I completely agree that generally a dose of fresh air and sunshine is the best thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Lilian

That is an excellent point... my kids are rarely very sick. Usually just a stuffy head, high temp, and generally unhappy. They need rest, panadol and a bit of mummy love!!  The sicker kids are though, the less they can do :-/]]></description>
