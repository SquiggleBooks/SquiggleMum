		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Kate , most mothers would have ignored it .
Both children will learn a lesson...the other mother will hopefully warn her child next time too.
 I digress to warn ... I went down one of those play centre slides  and I skinned both of my elbows (it really hurt and still does).Long sleeves or keep your elbows up.
I took a look from the top of one it was scary as and here was I encouraging my little boys to go down.

		<description><![CDATA[Wow you actually followed up... you went and spoke to the mother, that is a rare rare thing these days!

I hope it wasn&#039;t just you and your little one who learnt something from this... I hope the other mother and child also learnt from your example.

		<description><![CDATA[I had a laugh to myself on this one. The same thing would happen with my girls because we have what we call an &quot;own stupid fault rule.&quot; If they have been told and told not to sit at the bottom of the slide, then go ahead and get kicked because they are... well no sympathy.  But as you say, the only problem with that is that they then extrapolate and apply it to everyone!
Oops.
Still, getting a 3 year old to appologise is a feat in itself, so at least you&#039;re off to a good start.

		<description><![CDATA[I am sure it was worth the heaviness in the pit of the stomach.  Learning healthy &quot;shame&quot; is such an important thing, even if we might feel a little &quot;guilty&quot; about teaching it.  As you said... it is about a moral compass.  And it is an important preventer (if I can put it that way :)) of things like bullying in the future.

God chastens those he loves ... and He really knows how to love :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You captured so well how I feel about my own kids when I know they&#039;re feeling bad about something. Especially my 5yr old. He worries about things more than the other two do (a 7yr old and a 2yr old). He probably has the better sense of what&#039;s wrong and what&#039;s right. But anyway, I can often see in their faces when they&#039;re feeling guilty or worrying about something and I really feel for them.

Oh darn it. You&#039;ve made me miss them now. (They&#039;re at school &amp; daycare 2day.)

But I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll manage!

Great post.

Fantastic story Cath - what a great learning experience for everyone. Children can teach us such a lot - if only we are prepared to listen. I hope the other child and mother also took something away from it!
