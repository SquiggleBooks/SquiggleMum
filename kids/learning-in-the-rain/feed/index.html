		<description><![CDATA[This is a lovely post. Parts of Scotland only get 30 rain-free days a year! I grew up in a very wet part of England and can&#039;t imagine life without a lot of rain. The smell of damp is just normal!

Last week I was delivering a course called &quot;Rain or Shine - Getting outside whatever the weather&quot;. Someone phoned up beforehand and asked if it was cancelled because of the weather...!!!
