		<description><![CDATA[Hi
My 5 yr old boy asked lots of why&#039;s and started to collect some of his for the children who lost everything.  It has sort of snow balled with friends and colleagues donating and I now have a room full of toys and books for children.  I have distributed to people I know but I am left with many more toys and books.  Does anyone have a suggestion of how to get these to people who may want them as the charities I have contacted are not interested.

		<description><![CDATA[great post, my 4 year old girl is still very in the me me me phase of her development and if it is not affecting her in her real world she is ok.  that may be my fault as we have taught her tv shows/movies arent real they are pretend.  she is not interested or has not asked any questions..  Is this normal???
my 8 year old boy is very different, he is very worried.  He does not ask many questions but if he is watching tv i try explain excatly what is happening as i know he thinks and worries too much.  if i can explain what is going on in detail he seams to be ok.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for writing this post,I love how you&#039;ve covered the &#039;why&#039; questions, helping talk children through what has happened is so important in helping them understand what has happened and also be reassured that it won&#039;t keep happening every time it rains.  Sending love to you and all of the families in the flood affected regions.

		<description><![CDATA[The floods are so devastating. We are in Victoria and I had my suitcases packed ready for evacuation, as there was flash flooding 20mins away from our house. Luckily nothing else came close to our home, but it is teriffying. My seven year old, understands whats going on and was a little scared, he wrote a story ( he is into storywriting anyway at the moment) about what he has seen and feels. It was so heartbreaking to see that he is so worried. Great advice in this blog post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post! We&#039;re in Brissie too on the Northside, our flood peaked on Tuesday, like you my 4 year old has asked lots of difficult questions, one of his therapists lives in West End, his anxieties have been going through the roof this week and it&#039;s been meltdowns galore, (he has Aspergers). He even packed a bag of his toys for the boys and girls whose toys drowned. But today it really hit home just how much the floods had affected him, my hubby went into Brissie to help, all day J has been asking &quot;is dad going to drown&quot;, &quot;Will dad die because the floods are there&quot;, &quot;will dad be safe&quot; and so on. He had ahuge look of relief about him when Daddy returned home.  Glad you were safe and I hope your sister&#039;s home is ok x]]></description>
