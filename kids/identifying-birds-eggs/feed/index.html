		<description><![CDATA[It is a house sparrow. I have a nest in one of my knockout roses.  They just hatched about 2 weeks ago and had the same eggs you are showing.  She had four of them and if you venture too close to the nest you will hear her because she never seems to be too far away.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this! I have just returned from my morning walk with my dogs with half of a birds egg (ie the result of a hatching) and yours is the only site that helped me to identify it. I have a noisy miner&#039;s egg - I wanted it to be a blackbird!  Once again, congratulations on this research with your daughter. You are pointing the way to a fascinating life of enquiry and interest for her.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We just found the very same egg and it too was under trees on a path!! We loked on the internet and found your information - thanks, it helped us to identify our egg too! We think ours is a Murray Magpie egg as there are lots of those birds around our area.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[House sparrow. Have you checked that ALL the birds are local to your area? They do all look like quite common birds, but it could be a possible elimination.

How fantastic of the museums. Makes me more sure of renewing my membership to the Melbourne museum next time I&#039;m there, even if we don&#039;t get there quite as often as we used to :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[wow soooo cool to get a response from the museums!!! It really warms my heart to see large organisations such as these taking a few minutes to reply to an child&#039;s email... it&#039;s making these kinds of connections that our kids will remember for life!

		<description><![CDATA[It looks like the house sparrow shell to me. What a great exercise to go through with your child -- she&#039;s learning science, but more importantly she&#039;s learning how and where to ask for help! The fact that they actually did help is outstanding.
