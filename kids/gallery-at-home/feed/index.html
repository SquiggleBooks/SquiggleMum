		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve just finished framing and photographing our kids artwork :) I&#039;ve been looking for a print to hang beside the back door, but then thought what could be better than an abstract installation done by the littlest members of our family? I think it shows them that we value their imput, and makes them proud to be contributing to our family home :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My daughter announces from time to time &quot;we live in an art gallery!&quot;. I think she&#039;s referring to all the art on the walls - we have original prints, drawings and paintings (mainly from friends and artists in our community) but we have the kids pictures in frames along side the &quot;real&quot; art. I love the idea of little cards - lovely.]]></description>
