		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve discovered I LOVE to colour-in. My boys can take it or leave it, but I&#039;ve realised, while colouring in with them, that I actually delight in it. So I&#039;ve bought myself some adult colouring in books and some lovely pencils. What joy! What simple pleasure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love, love, love jumping in puddles and playing in the rain...Brisbane is the perfect place for that - wet warm summers make it not unpleasant if you get wet through :)
