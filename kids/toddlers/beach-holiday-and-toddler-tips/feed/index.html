		<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful post. I haven&#039;t visited your blog for a long time. The pics are so calming to look at.

I&#039;m in Victoria (should I mention that? lol.) We&#039;ve had some lovely beach days and more to come I&#039;m sure as Summer approaches and it was a long, cold, fantastic Winter.

A spotted sea hare? How interesting. Like you, I would have thought it was a sea slug. Pretty special to see.
