		<description><![CDATA[Wow, you&#039;re brave! I&#039;ve still got my twins in their cots because I&#039;m not looking forward to twice the &#039;let&#039;s play get out of bed&#039; game... And while they&#039;re not climbing out I figure they&#039;re still pretty safe in their cots. The room looks just beautiful.

As for the dummy situation, our oldest had one that he was totally attached to (but only had for sleeping). In the end we just left it up to him, with a big dose of incentive in the form of a &#039;big boy bike&#039;. We had the bike in the house and told him it was his - as soon as he chose to be a big boy and get rid of his dummy. He was just over 3 at the time. He had a few false-starts but in the end it was he who decided to throw them in the bin and there wasn&#039;t a tear in sight. Neither of my twins have dummies (not for my want of trying, I might add!!) so I guess we won&#039;t have to deal with that with them. Baby #4 might be a different story :)

		<description><![CDATA[What a gorgeous jungle bed cover! It&#039;s nice to hear of other cot-to-bed transitions.... my little girl also went into a BIG bed this week. 1st night not so great, but it&#039;s been ok since. The afternoon sleep is more of a struggle though!
Leave the dummy for another day... plenty of time! :)

		<description><![CDATA[How funny that you blogged about this - we&#039;re going through the same process at the moment. I&#039;m trying to encourage him to start sleeping without a dummy, with the aim that he can move to his big boy bed once he can do that. It doesn&#039;t seem to be working. Do you have any ideas on getting them off dummies? My son is three so he&#039;s definitely ready to be weaned!

PS - I love the bedroom decor :o)

		<description><![CDATA[That is a beautiful bed! I love the jungle theme. I love picking bright colours rather than just the traditional blue (or pink). Riley&#039;s been in her toddler bed for over a year now - she hated the cot but I&#039;m looking forward to getting her into a big bed so we can have story time actually on the bed. Not sure what the maximum weight is on the toddler one!

I wouldn&#039;t worry about the dummy. I still give Riley a bottle because she never took a dummy. She always brushes her teeth afterwards and although I&#039;d like to get rid of it - it&#039;s all about timing. Her 2 year molars having pushing through for months and I think getting rid of it will be a whole lot easier if I just wait for a bit.

Great photos of your little man!

		<description><![CDATA[Congratulations Cath. It was such a big deal for me to pack up Ed&#039;s cot. It made me ask my hub if we could re-think the &quot;no more kids&quot; idea. I made the mistake of trying to give up cot and dummy together. I would never do that again. It made the transition much more difficult than it needed to be. Definitely keep the dummy until he is completely settled in his bed ... that&#039;s my advice, anyway.

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, it&#039;s such an exciting transition.
The thing I love best is being able to sit on the bed with them for storytime and lying together for cuddles.
Such a gorgeous room! :)
