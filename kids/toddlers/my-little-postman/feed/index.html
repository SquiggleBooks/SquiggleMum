		<description><![CDATA[I laughed when I read your post but thought &quot;I&#039;ve got no suggestions&quot;, but the more I think on it ...
My baby is also at a posting stage, but he doesn&#039;t seem quite as obsessed as your son.  But he does like these 2 slightly forbidden activities (which I supervise from a distance) - posting the tokens in the Connect 4 game and putting plastic shop cards in and out of a wallet.  I&#039;ve kept them as not readily available games, so that he thinks he is in luck when he managees to get his hands on something casually left on the couch.

		<description><![CDATA[that is just am awesome photo! LOVE it!

My girls had a huge toilet fetish when they were about one, just walking and desperate to put anything and everything, including themselves in the toilet. We had to put a lock on the outside of the door to keep them out! LOL

		<description><![CDATA[How frustrating for you. This is along similar lines to my next blog post which I am just formulating in my head.

Redirecting doesn&#039;t work for me, yet it is the only suggestion I have for you. It&#039;s tricky when our children are so focussed. An admirable, but difficult quality at 3 yrs old. Well, difficult for us maybe :-)

		<description><![CDATA[Just wait til he DOES decide to use the real postbox - you will not get a moment&#039;s peace until you make him a letter or card (actually MANY letters and cards!) to post in it for him to find!!!! How do I know? Miss 13 was a big postie fan!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is very cute! We went through the posting stage but not quite to this extent. We only &quot;posted&quot; in the bin, any drawers left slightly ajar, through the venetian blinds and under lounges. Thankfully, our bathroom door is kept closed, so we avoided the toilet and nappy buckets (though I see you have a three year old, so probably need easy access to the bathroom). Apart from &quot;sensible posting&quot; and also teaching appropriate use of the posted toys (e.g. cups for drinking not posting), can&#039;t help much. Of course, I guess keep in mind that &quot;this too shall pass&quot;!

		<description><![CDATA[Hmm, I have some ideas but I&#039;m not sure if he would give up what he is doing (they are mainly redirecting).

A sensory box - I&#039;ve made using small containers with a small hole for hands - different materials (rice, flour etc) the putting his hand in action would be the link.

Grab a tissue box (used) and have him place the items into the shoe box? Like toys etc could be made into a game where he sees if it can fit :)

I did have another buy have forgotten :(
