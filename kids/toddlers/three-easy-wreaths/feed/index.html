		<description><![CDATA[They are gorgeous - and clever in their simplicity!

The wreath on our front door was made by my daughter, with her grandmother, a few years ago - i guess she was 6 or so at the time. They bent a coathanger into a wreath shape, (cutting off the hanging bit but you could keep that)then tied many strips of platic bags onto the wire. It was all spray painted gold and some baubles were tied on along with a gold ribbon for hanging it by. It looks really effective, used recyled materials (so was cheap) and kep them busy for some time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for popping over to Ireland to say &quot;hi&quot;.

Was just chatting about handprint wreaths this morning in Sunday School!

All great ideas - perfect for me to do with my 3 some cold, wet, dark winter afternoon, while you bake in the heat!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We just had fun doing this with wrapping paper. We did have an advent wreath to do today but with snow falling I&#039;m not brave enough to go out to get the evergreen stuff to make it all.

We&#039;ve taken a few pictures down and are using the picture hooks to hang our wreaths on.
