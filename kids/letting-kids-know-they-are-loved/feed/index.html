		<description><![CDATA[I love the banana idea! I think my kids have decided they like to be shown love through big plastic toys. I am not sure if that is really the way they like to be shown love or they are old enough to lay it on thick!

I love the bananagram idea...will give it a go for sure!

		<description><![CDATA[So cute!  I have a little gift giver here, she&#039;s just like her father and brings me flowers, strange pebbles, shells and all sorts of things she finds.  I do little lunches for her cut into shapes and things.  I also spread out buying our craft supplies and things like that so she gets little presents that way - a new bottle of paint is all it needs!

		<description><![CDATA[Cute Cath!  Think I&#039;m going to steal the idea and use it on my husband tomorrow.  He takes a standard peanut butter sanga, 2 gingernut biscuits and a banana to work every day.  Might need a bit of love at lunch :  )

...Oh and I&#039;ll try it on Miss M too!  Thanks for the encouragement.

		<description><![CDATA[That reminds me of these gorgeous lunch box notes I saw somewhere around the webs.The mum would make up these tags to attach to her daughters lunch box every week when she went to kinder. Apparently she loved them so much she&#039;d show them for show and tell each day :)
