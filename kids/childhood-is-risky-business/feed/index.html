		<description><![CDATA[How interesting to read this article. As an educator and mother it worries me about the lack of resilience children are starting school with. Times have changed so much from the freedom we experienced as children. It makes me wonder how the next generation are going to cope when they are confronted with trauma or some of life&#039;s greater challenges. Lets hope this message gets spread that it&#039;s okay for children to take risks in their physical play and that they should be encouraged to do so. Organised sport is also a great way for children to take risks in a &#039;controlled&#039; way.]]></description>
