		<description><![CDATA[Hi Folks

I&#039;m going to point you all to my facebook page where I have photos of sandpits. Yes I&#039;m a geek. My job is to support and encourage outdoor play and sandpits are super!!!

Basically, the bigger the sandpit the better the experience...

Enjoy...long live outdoor sandplay!

		<description><![CDATA[Sand play is big at our house too, even the rabbit loves it. Making volcanos is the best fun, we use vinegar poured into a container of bicarb of soda, or baking soda built into the mouth of the volcano. As soon as you pour the vinegar in, it froths up and runs down the sides just like real lava. My 6 year old just loves it. My 2 year old prefers baking with sand and water, mixing and mixing with kitchen utensils.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We have a poor excuse for a sandpit - it&#039;s more like a bunch of sand dumped under a cubby house - and it was already at this house when we moved here. I usually take the sand out of it and put it into trays for the children to play with on the deck. I&#039;ve had visons of building a giant sand box for the kids, but this post has just changed all that. I can&#039;t believe I never thought to just use some weed mat and a few rocks. Much more pleasing to the eye and a little easier to do.Thanks Cath!

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Cath, good to find you in the blogging world. I honestly don&#039;t think much about sandpits :) My boys (now 7 and 3) will dig anywhere and everywhere. We do have a sandpit, but it seems to be the least fav digging spot. even the dog prefers to make holes under the house :) Maybe we need to broaden our horizons and create a bigger and better space for our boys

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,

Love the new look site.

We have a cubby which is elevated and the underneath acts as a sandpit, although we haven&#039;t filled it with sand yet!!  Need to get cracking on that.

Emiy loves the sandpit at daycare though!]]></description>

(the new layout looks great btw!)
