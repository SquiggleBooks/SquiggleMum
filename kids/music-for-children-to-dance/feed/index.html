		<description><![CDATA[Thankyou so much for the reminder...I just googled Rimsky-Korsakov and am playing Scheherazade: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMKTaLaYBB8

Immediately my 4yr old daughter (who loves to dance too), closed her eyes, lifted her arms, and started a made up song while doing &quot;ballet&quot; back to the kitchen to get some more watermelon. LOVE IT! Thankyou :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve never been into kids music for the munchkin, other than when he&#039;s watching TV or a DVD. At 10 months we were dancing to Get Up, Stand Up by Bob Marley, waltzing to Waltz of the Flowers at 2, at 3 he was rapping to something he&#039;d heard in Daddycar (not sure about that one!), and at 4 he&#039;s attempting to reproduce Gene Kelly&#039;s Singing in the Rain. There are a multitude of others. I totally agree that variety in music is essential. I also think dancing with boys is to be encouraged. The munchkin makes it look so cool - he has all the smooth moves!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You both look gorgeous in your tutus!

I love that my kids love all kinds of music. Recently I found my old Abba Gold CD and my big kids adore that at the moment. Abba and a bit of River Dance thrown in for good measure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are mad fans of jazz and have a great local community jazz station. We now put the radio on every morning while we have breakfast so the boys are getting a good dose of Coltrain, Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holliday. My 2 year old always moves to the music and says that he &#039;loves&#039; this song whenever a new one comes on!

I love the bath with classical music idea. It would do wonders for my 3 boys as well!

And Justine Clarke is by far our favourite also. She&#039;s on repeat in the car.]]></description>
