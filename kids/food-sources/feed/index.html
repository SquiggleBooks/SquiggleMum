		<description><![CDATA[My big girl has just worked out that meat comes from animals, she&#039;s quite excited about that.  And they love corn on the cob - the first time I gave it to them I cut the kernels off and they were very indignant!
Did you know that one of the enzymes in pineapple denatures proteins, that&#039;s what tingles on your tongue and attacks your fingers.  Meat marinaded in pineapple will fall apart.
I&#039;m wanting a vege/herb garden but I have a black thumb, so I&#039;m dropping lots of hints to my husband :)

		<description><![CDATA[We love corn on the cob too.  We also shell peas which can be great fun.  We grow a few vegies and are planning on planting some fruit trees in our new backyard.  All good fun and perfect for a toddler learning all about the world.

		<description><![CDATA[Well, I&#039;m not sure if my son counts as a city child because we have a fair bit of land and space for growing food (but we&#039;re not on a farm), but he is currently fascinated by how bananas grow.  I think it is because they grow pointing upwards.  Also, he loves coconuts.  They are cool, you can hear the milk inside and it is fun and therapeutic to break them open.

		<description><![CDATA[I confess to being amazed after reading Animal Vegetable Miracle that some children in the US didn&#039;t know that carrots grew in the dirt!  I&#039;ve always thought that wasn&#039;t the case here but of late I am beginning to wonder...

So nice to see connections being made and exciting lessons learnt about this stuff. Living on some land our kids have a lot of exposure to where some food comes from, but we still often talk about how other food is grown. Every now and then there is even a food that stumps me... mostly spices these days, I have no idea how many of them come before they&#039;ve been ground up and packaged!

		<description><![CDATA[@Juliet

There&#039;s a growing trend of &quot;Kitchen Gardens&quot; in schools in Australia at the moment, which is wonderful.  I&#039;d love to see more schools with chooks though.  I&#039;ll look into Eggloo&#039;s (what a cute name...)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lovely post - thank you.

Two thoughts spring to mind. Many years ago, a very urban nursery became famous in Scotland for its 1 square metre plots. Their outdoor space was so tiny, they did everything in miniature. They even grew wheat which they harvested and baked bread with it.

Angus Council - which is responsible for more than 90 pre-school settings has a lovely growing project happening. Each pre-school has been given two tyres, a strawberry planter, potatoes, strawberry plants and peas to grow, compost and sequencing books. They&#039;ve even been given card to use to record progress for a Council-wide display in Autumn. It&#039;s such a simple idea but lovely in that these are traditional crops for this area.

I don&#039;t know whether you can buy them in Australia, but here it&#039;s possible to buy &quot;Eggloos&quot; to house a couple of hens! Some schools are taking the plunge and getting them.
