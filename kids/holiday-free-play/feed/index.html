I think my favourtie times these school holidays also involve free play at the beach... watching the delight in my 3 year old as she kicked the water and felt sand in her fingers, and my 7 year old&#039;s joy as she built and collected and ran and laughed. Wish I could foster more &quot;simple&quot; days like these in our lives.]]></description>
