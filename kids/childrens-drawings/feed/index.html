		<description><![CDATA[Too true Kerri, too true. Usually I go with, &quot;What are you thinking about while you&#039;re painting today...?&quot; (see this post: http://squigglemum.com/activities/finger-paint-progress/ )

This is a fabulous painting with which to make the point that even when we do try to guess, we often underestimate our children&#039;s understanding ;-)

Tell you what it is tomorrow...]]></description>
