		<description><![CDATA[I just love this post.  I just love play that is outside, when I can just enjoy watching the interaction and play with my children and the natural world around them.  It&#039;s more entertaining to me than any show I can think of.  My kids get a fair amount of interaction with children of many different ages, and of course a large amount of interaction with each other.

		<description><![CDATA[What great cubbies and interesting differences.

My 4yo plays with children her own age at organized activities (Kinder, swimming, dancing) but outside of this most of her friends tend to be older (6-12), simply because our friends, family and neighbours have older children. She particularly adores one older girl who she helps celebrate her birthday each year with a trip out for high tea. The older girl is so patient and attentive to her, it is wonderful to see :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where I live, all the local kids tend to go around together in the bakckyard, surrounding bush and school playground for hours, boys and girls (aged 3-9), making cubbies, finding insects, making insect playgrounds, making games etc.  The younger ones following the older ones.
I have noticed with my children growing up the differences in the way my son and daughter played with the same toys.  EG play stroller - daughter lovingly placed soft toys in it, tucked them up etc whereas son didn&#039;t care what was in it, just raced it from one side of the room to the other; dollshouse - daughter arranged furniture and people, son drove cars all over it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love that you have so much in your yard for the kids to &#039;source&#039;.  Earlier this week I enjoyed watching my son play hide and seek with some older kids.  I was quite surprised with how well he coped.
