		<description><![CDATA[We love music too. I play piano, but so far for my kids, it is all about singing (and dancing). I am constantly amazed by my daughter&#039;s ability to remember lyrics (even for adult songs she has only heard once).

I&#039;m still in two minds about whether to teach my kids piano (when they get older). I&#039;m not sure I would have the patience - may have to outsource that one!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is such a precious photo and music is just so important, isn&#039;t it? We have so much fun with music and singing and dancing and I love watching how my kids react to music and singing. Their responses are so innate and raw. They come from deep within them. Ed cannot sit still when music is on and he has been like that for as long as I can rememeber and Em has taught herself to play a cheap keyboard she got for her second Xmas. In our house, there&#039;s no fighting it, the rhythm is gonna getcha ....

		<description><![CDATA[I was raised in a very musical family and have passed the music gene onto my grandsons. My Dad actually gives music lessons to one of my grandsons, his great grandson. These lessons are special in so many ways beyond the actual lessons themselves. I find music in pre-school is a universal language. Thanks for the post and tell your kids to keep on singing and playing.  :), The picture is too cute!]]></description>

It was a hand-me-down from one of the older boys at church who has graduated to &quot;real&quot; guitars!  It doesn&#039;t plug into an amp, but as far as play instruments go it&#039;s a pretty good copy :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s rarely a moment in our house that there is not music of some sort being listened to, played or sung. Although none of us have any huge talent we do all get a lot of enjoyment out of it, especially my 3yo old son who has recently decided he wants to be a harmonica player when he grows up - on the days he&#039;s not being a fireman of course!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is a really great post! I am quite jealous of your husband being able to play guitar...I did lessons when I was a kid but gave it up to play netball...and I always kind of regretted it. Maybe its time to learn again!We do sing ALOT in this house....My mum used to turn up the music and sing when she did the housework and I must admit we sing through pretty much everything we do (dishwashing, bathtime, in the car etc)

Gorgeous photo of your kids and their guitars...Yes, I think a musical sibling group is a real possibility there!]]></description>
