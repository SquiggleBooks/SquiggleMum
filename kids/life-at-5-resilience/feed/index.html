		<description><![CDATA[I am really enjoying this series. I started my blog as a way to address the lack of resilience I was witnessing in children through both my personal life and my professional career as educator and counsellor. The growing numbers of anxiety and depression in young people had me researching ways to try and combat this. It has been great to see many of my ideas backed up by the examples on the programme.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I managed to catch the last half of the episode.  I love this series.
My husband and I have both decided that our children will not be very resilient as we are not so certain that we could wait 2 minutes to eat the mashmallow ourselves, so what hope do they have ;)
I was in awe of Shine&#039;s father&#039;s resilience.  I remember watching the episode when he lost his cleaning business.  Now look at him - studying to be a doctor.  That little girl certainly has an amazing set of role models.
Can&#039;t wait for part 2.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Spewin I missed it.  I saw the first two in the series and they were great.  We don&#039;t get digital TV out here in the middle of nowhere, but I&#039;m sure ABC will show it again or bring out the DVD.]]></description>
