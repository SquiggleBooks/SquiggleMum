		<description><![CDATA[I have two girls and they always have something happening on their face.  As a kid, all the photos I have of myself, I&#039;m covered with meucrochrame (sp?!) as I always fell on my face.  My girls are the same lol and why hide it?  Unless it&#039;s school photos, in which case I would probably leave off on the bright red solution and pick something a little less obvious.  And for a black eye?  A little pressed powder would certainly be on my to-do list for that morning.  As for airbrushing or photoshopping school photos...where does it stop?  Should we add in some teeth if they&#039;ve had teeth fall out as well???  Not for my curly girlies thanks.  They&#039;re PERFECT just the way they are - blemishes or not.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think I would have done the same as you. If my child was worried, I would have used a little pressed powder. In reality, the powder would no doubt be rubbed off by the time the photos were taken.

My older son was missing both front teeth for his kindy photo (they fell out the week before it was taken). We haven&#039;t had any other significant issues. It makes me sad that school photos are being photoshopped. In this day and age where there are so many photos of our children out there, these school photos aren&#039;t as significant as they were, to my mind anyway. Growing up my parents rarely took photos as it was too expensive to process the films, so my school photos were a significant record of my growth each year. I don&#039;t think that there would be too many kids who could say that now.

Last year when my daughter was in Year 3 i was astounded how much effort some of the parents put into hairstyles. I&#039;m hairstyle-challenged, so my poor daughter is rather limited in what I can do for her, but some of the girls had the most elaborate hairstyles just for the photos. once again, it seems to be losing perspective somewhat (to me, anyway).

I hope that your daughter had fun with her photos. My younger two came home after theirs today full of stories of the funny names the photographer used to get the kids&#039; attention.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I once had a broken arm in a school photo and mostly hid it behind someone else. But looking back that is my favourite photo because it has a story, it is linked to definite experiences, I can remember it. I don&#039;t have that for any of my other school photos. So unless she was unhappy I wouldn&#039;t do anything, if she was then I would tell her my story and if she still wanted it I&#039;d put something on, but I wouldn&#039;t offer straight up.

My sister has an enormous birthmark on her neck and face, she got a lot of teasing about it growing up. So for her getting some camouflage makeup was a very good thing, she eventually had laser treatment that lightened it. I wonder what the effect of using makeup for smaller, temporary problems is - does it make people sympathise with others who have a worse issue, or does it tell them it should be covered? I don&#039;t know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My youngest 2 (twins) are 19 so I don&#039;t have to deal with that question.  I think I would have put a litttle foundation on it too.

		<description><![CDATA[All very interesting... particularly as my little 5yo came up with a bumpy red rash on his cheeks the day before his school photos recently!  I did put a bit of moisteriser-foundation to try to tone it down slightly.

I have however heard of parents getting their photos back in the last few years and realising that their child has been de-freckled, without them knowing.  I agree that that type of photoshopping is wrong.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I probably would have done the same thing too, if I had a daughter.  I have a son though and wouldn&#039;t have put make up on him - that raises other issues doesn&#039;t it.

My biggest worry for my son and him starting school is that he sweats a lot!  He gets it from me and I get it from my Dad, it&#039;s not really something you can hide though.

I believe in recording the story that goes with photos, so along side the school photo I would have written a little story about how the black eye came to be.]]></description>
