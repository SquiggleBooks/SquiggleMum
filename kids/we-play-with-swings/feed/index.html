		<description><![CDATA[I think when I used to be on a swing i used to feel like was flying ~~ set free like a bird...

&quot;I love looking for opportunities to encourage independent problem solving through play.  I could have told her what we were going to make with the box.  I could have fixed the problem with the bear falling out.  I could have done a lot of things for her, but where would the learning be in that&quot; could not agree more with you here...

My subject this week that I covered was this ~~ http://romanticflairoriginal.blogspot.com/2010/06/clownsentertainingdramatizingrelating.html]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Immy loves to swing but I haven&#039;t decided if we will buy one for the yard or not, there really isn&#039;t quite enough space for an a frame set, maybe our lemon tree will grow really quickly and we can hang one from the tree LOL.  I love that your swing set has been loved by many children before yours.

		<description><![CDATA[Ha ha ha! For whatever stupid reason, our insurance company will not allow us to have a swing set at the preschool. Seriously! That said, the kids are constantly making their own swings from ropes they hang from our monkey bars or tree branches. Yesterday, a couple of boys were swinging on a string of vinyl belts they tied together. Our stupid insurance company gave us a problem and the kids solved it!

I echo Joyce&#039;s comment -- I love that the swing set has a history!

		<description><![CDATA[I love the history of this swing, and also I fully agree with you about letting your child make her own swing and sort the problem out herself. Too many times, parents jump in and take over, and I think a lot of children are getting a clear &#039;I can&#039;t&#039; message from this sort of vibe.
