		<description><![CDATA[Cath - the kids cant ride the bikes on the grass. Flat yard but too hard on the grass/mud - need a nice smooth surface path hence my little dream. Gus&#039;s frustration of trying to take his bike out to ride on the grass (after getting bored of this 2-3 pedals he can do up and down the back verandah tiled area) is what got me started. Dont think the owner would like it if I started ripping up the grass and laying down an asphalt bike track as wonderful as I think it might be .....I wonder if the bond would cover it.Nah - this is the guy who wouldnt even let us have a swing set in the backyard on the grass &quot;in case it ruined the turf&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@Michele

What a brilliant idea for a flat yard! Alas, we are completely hilly, so wouldn&#039;t work for us.  I think you could still do &quot;road signs&quot; in a rented yard, even if you don&#039;t have the proper track.  What about making them on stakes so that you just push them into the ground...?  But oh for a car wash, and petrol pump!! Fab ideas. I totally get it. xx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[great find at that price and can have so much fun with.

We are playing Vets here a lot - can see a playstand coming in handy for something to do with that ongoing game

On another topic - I had a good laugh today that I have so share with you.

Was sitting  out in the backyard with the kids enjoying this lovely non-almost winter weather and dreaming up plans for an awesome bike path in the backyard.currently is flat for the most part but all grass with nowhere decent to ride a scooter/bike/gyrocar). So here I was planning this bike track with a proper surfaced track/road winding its way around the garden complete with road markings and street signs like you see in some (cool) parks and maybe even a petrol pump or car wash..... (hey it was great) and thinking to myself &quot;Hmmm I will have to share this idea with Cath/Squigglemum shes about the only person I know that would &quot;get it&quot; LOL.

Really wishing I could actually put it into action as could be so much fun but alas we are renting...oh well one day! Hopefully when the kids are still young enough to appreciate it/have fun with it.]]></description>
