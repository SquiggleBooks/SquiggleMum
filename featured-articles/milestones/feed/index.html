		<description><![CDATA[@KDL - You make a very good point, and one I wondered whether someone would make.  Thank you for bringing it up. You, and other mothers like you, are the reason I said &quot;most of the time&quot; there is no need to worry.  Most of the time, late teething, late walking, even late talking is not of great concern.  MOST of the time.  But if as a mother you&#039;ve got that unsettled feeling that won&#039;t be quietened by the assurances of experts - I agree that you should go with your gut!  As mothers we are the experts on our own children, and we have to be their advocates.  That&#039;s our job.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As a mom who was constantly told not to worry about the milestones with my oldest child (she was just a little late on a few of them and very late on talking) only to finally be told at 4.5 years that she is somewhere on the autism spectrum, I have to disagree just a little. My gut was telling me at 18 months that something was amiss, and if all the &quot;experts&quot; hadn&#039;t convinced me otherwise I might have pursued more vigorous early intervention instead of waiting until age 3 to even begin that process...not to mention we now have two more children that I worry constantly about whether they are really as on track as I&#039;m trying to convince myself that they are...total head games!
Anyway my point is: yes, each child reaches their milestones at their own time. Teeth are certainly a milestone I wouldn&#039;t worry about. Yes, enjoy each stage that your child reaches...I still do with all of my children. But if something is niggling at the back of your brain, don&#039;t let other people convince you to just disregard it...learn as much as you can until _you_ are satisfied that all is well. I hope that makes sense - just a little soapbox of mine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[True! One little fella in my MG has only 3 teeth and he is 18 months. His mum worries now and then but, they will come. My Irish MIL had a great saying (she has a great old saying for everything in life!) when I was worrying about my 1st child reaching milestones... only of course, I can&#039;t remember what it was now!?! I&#039;ll have to ask her... gee I was helpful there. ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was walking at 9 months with no teeth.  My kids have all started teething late as well.  Thankfully they haven&#039;t walked early though (generally over 12 months)!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[An interesting fact is that teething is one of the only milestones that is genetic/hereditary rather than developmental. My Mum is a dental hygienist and so always has good advice and interesting facts about teeth. Amy got her first two just shy of her FOURTH month! and by 6 months she had two top and two bottom. OUCH on the breastfeeding! Will be interesting to see if Stella follows suit and confirms the theory that its a family trait - early or late teething!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Neither of my twins got any teeth before 13 months ...then the other got his first two weeks later.

I have always avoided the competitive nature of the my child is better than yours because he did xyz better or quicker or younger. I say ... in HIS time ...too.
I barely recorded any milestones ages anyway ... mostly  am too busy and too forgetful LOL.

Lovely post.

PS I couldn&#039;t wait for them to walk and talk now I spend my day saying sit down, don&#039;t run , shush up.]]></description>
