		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,
Glad to see you had such a wonderful week of play dough activities. My two year old daughter just loves to make pretend birthday cakes and sing Happy Birthday to us all.  She uses cut up drinking straws for the candles and then proceeds to blow them all out.  Another favourite is making pretend pizzas and cutting them all up into wedges.  I also switched to using the method of making play dough with the boiling water instead of in the saucepan. It saves having to wash up the saucepan and it is ready to use within minutes. There are so many things that can be added to your play dough kit. I just keep finding more and more...I think we almost need a bigger tub! I loved reading your article. Well done :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I recently had my first foray into playdough, thanks to you Cath!  We made snails and butterflies, and pushed pegs into the playdough. We made pretend biscuits and baked them in the pretend oven.  And you can also make a great chocolate cake with cream of tarter!  I keep mine in the fridge so it lasts longer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi fantastic ideas I have never tried before.

We use the same recipe however I use a heat proof microwave bowl and cook it for 30 second intervals mixing inbetween.

We usually make a restaurant too.]]></description>
