		<description><![CDATA[My kids have said the exact same thing...when I clean house and sometimes when I come out dressed and with my makeup and hair done?  Who&#039;s coming over, where are we going?
Sad, but true.
I do have tips on my site about homekeeping, though, I&#039;ve come up with a system that works for us.  As long as I actually do it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Uh - I DO try but I have often given up.  Tend to tidy the living room at night.  But the place is NEVER up to the par I expected before the twins arrived - 3 years ago.  I did okay up until then but now there is just no keeping up with then.  I remember a line from Erma Bombeck - cleaning the house while you have kids living at home is like shovelling the driveway while it&#039;s still snowing!  Absolutely love your blog though - good to know there is someone in the same boat!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh gosh do I hear you!   I keep hoping our state of continual disarray is the result of living in a too-small space, and that it will change when we move soon (now I have the &quot;we&#039;ll just need to pack it away in boxes soon anyway&quot; excuse...), but the truth is that I have always been messy and may always be.  When it started to look really messy in the past, I&#039;d just have to schedule a party.  Invite 20 people over two weeks out, and you&#039;ll just have to get it into shape!  How about a weekly dinner group?  I&#039;m only half kidding.  I think hosting a playgroup every week or two at our new house  might help.  (I&#039;m thinking about the previous poster&#039;s 2 toys at a time rule.  I think we have about 50 out!!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Mess is proof of a fun day.  As long as the kids help put away before dinner its all good.   We have a general rule of two toys at a time though.  One goes away before another comes out.   Dust and dirt is another matter.  Every Saturday they are vacumed and mopped, we have a twirly duster zoe loves to use too.  Just think if people come over and see washing on the chair at least they know you ware clean clothes.  The only thing we have a cleaning binge over if people pull up is the toilets,  never know!]]></description>
