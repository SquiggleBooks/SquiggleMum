		<description><![CDATA[Hi there

My name is Robyn and I have had the worst day with my 3 year old son Jack. Jack has only just turned 3 and I honestly thought it would get easier.....NOT!

I took him to Kindy gym this morning and he was being a little naughty so I took him over to the side to sit down and have a chat. This was the start of the tantrum. I was trying to calm him down but he wouldnt stop screaming and crying. I had no choice but to remove him from kindy gym and take him straight home, hoping that he would learn that this sort of behaviour is not acceptable!

Once in the car he was still screaming and crying and resorted to throwing anything that was near him at me, whilst I was driving.

On arriving home the tantrum continued but eventually subsided and he apologised. He understood that I wouldnt allow him to act in this way but his tantrums have continued during the afternoon, also...but not as bad

I was very encouraged to read your comments on Parenting Australia....I dont know where this particular mail will be sent but just thought I would post a reply and say thanks....nice to have like minded mums around that understand :)]]></description>
