		<description><![CDATA[My 3yo, Max, has a *bit* of an obsession with a scene he saw in passing when we were watching Drop Dead Fred (remember? Rick Myal) where he gets his head stuck in a fridge door and when he pulls it out again his face is flat...well Max constantly shadows me in the kitchen waiting for the door to open so he can stick his head in (or any one of his toy&#039;s heads) and pretend to have it squashed and goes in to fits of giggles about it. This has been going on for over 6 WEEKS now and I have had to make him little fridges for his spiderman and other figurines to go through the head-flattening routine.......ok, at what point to I take him to a professional therapist???? Needless to say if a toy is missing we FIRST look in the fridge and then under the lounge etc...]]></description>

She looked like a court jester. Of course I took a picture. She wore them all evening.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So funny I had to revisit your page to let you know.  Yesterday I had nothing to say... today is a different story.  I left Zoe in the lounge room watching playschool, went and changed Riley and did some washing.  I heard Zoe yelling Mum Mum come on quick.  So I hurried back to the front of the house to my surprise she is getting in on the moving action.  She had moved two lounge chairs a recliner, the kiddy seats and a bean bag.  The room was a total disaster and she was so proud to help us move and rearrange things.  I just had to laugh and thank her and asked her to help me put things back the way I had them.  But I did take a couple of photos for the album.]]></description>
