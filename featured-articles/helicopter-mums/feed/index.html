		<description><![CDATA[Here in the UK schools and other organisations are moving towards the concept of weighing up the benefits of an activity in relation to the risk posed.

Many organisations to do with health and safety and children are making very encouraging noises. The Royal Soc for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) advocates making things &quot;as safe as necessary, not as safe as possible&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s always a difficult balance to find.  Our role as parents is to teach and equip our children to become capable and adaptable (among many other things) adults.  I think we need to get a good understanding of what natural abilities our children have and give them a  chance to &#039;stretch a little&#039; and  work things out, be it conflict with another child or how to get down from the tree themselves before we jump in to rescue.  Sometimes they need a little instruction or help, but seeing a child succeed in working out a situation mostly on their own is great - it fills them with such confidence and pride.  Learning to measure risk, think through situations and deal with conflict are critical skills for life.  As Mums we a designed by God to be nurturing and protective, we just need to keep a measure on our emotions so as not to suffocate our children, but we are also given instinct which I think is important to learn to trust.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I work pretty hard to find the right balance between supervising and allowing my daughter freedom. It is complicated by the fact that due to her developmental differences she can have pretty serious behavior issues, including aggression toward other children. I am always at least listening to her to keep track of where she&#039;s at, what she&#039;s doing and whether or not I need to step in for the OTHER child&#039;s sake. What drives me absolutely nuts is when I see other moms with &quot;typical&quot; kids not making the same effort. I watched a child nearly yank another kid&#039;s head from his shoulders with two fists full of hair. The other child was saying &quot;stop&quot;, &quot;let go&quot;, etc. Mom was standing 10 feet away chatting with another Mom. My daughter can&#039;t even gently brush another child&#039;s hair without setting off alarm bells in most of the adults who supervise her. It&#039;s a double standard that&#039;s hard to swallow. So am I a helicopter that feels like she&#039;s the only one on duty, or just a responsible Mom who&#039;s trying to teach her kid how to get along in the world by paying attention to how she&#039;s doing...

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Cath,
I was such a helicopter mum when my first child was born. Anything that fell on the ground was whipped into boiling water in a flash!
You and Kate are right. I had very protective parents, yet in the 70s and 80s we were given quite a lot of personal space as children in comparison to children of the early 21st century. It&#039;s sad to think that media and the world has degressed to such an alarmist state that we think we need to.
Even the prospect of leaving my little brood to fly to Brisbane for a weekend makes me a little sad (and my oldest is 15 and glad to see my go, by the way.)
I&#039;m really looking forward to meeting you there too!
Blessings,
Paula]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will put what I wrote on Childhood 101

Oh. That is me at the moment and I dont care. I cross between being a Chinook (Drop in at any situation to rescue my child, provide food relief, etc) and a Black Hawk (spy from afar and then jump in when needed to fight battles). Hopefully oneday I will become a scenic flight operator but until I am confident my children can protect themselves I will be there. They are only 3 &amp; 1.

		<description><![CDATA[@Caroline

Thanks so much for your encouraging and inspiring response!  I love the phrase &quot;responsible risk&quot;...

I think later on in the conversation I made the point that we are not actually raising children - we are raising them to be independent adults, eventually!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Girls,

I empathize with all you write.  However, the end result of helicopter parenting is learned helplessness.  A frightening and psychologically damaging thing for a child.

I let my 8 year old go for a walk this morning with the dog.  he was gone for half an hour and came back beaming.  he was SO proud of himself. My heart was singing for him, but how i felt about the experience is irrelevant.

teaching responsible risk grows smart, creative, resilient and independent children.    we as parents, need to teach our children to experience life &#039;outside of us&#039; as soon as they are developmentally able.

we also need to remind ourselves that we CAN give our children the childhood that we so often reminisce about, if only we are willing.

cheers,
x]]></description>
