		<description><![CDATA[Our family went to an informal piano recital the other day and afterward at the refreshments portion of the event my daughter was running around with her little friend. After a couple of tries at asking them to use walking feet I decided to try to get them more actively engaged in a quiet game. We played eye spy for several turns each and I was thrilled that it helped them quiet down and even SIT for short periods of time. We stuck with non-imaginary items in the room, but it was still fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gorgeous - she&#039;s very clever. As a little experiment I just asked my 3yo old son what it was a picture of (wondering if all 3yo&#039;s can see the obvious purple elephant) and his response... &quot;That&#039;s a cool fish.&quot; LOL Her art is being appreciated already! :-)]]></description>
