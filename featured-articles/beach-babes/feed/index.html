		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,
It&#039;s great to read how you enjoyed yourselves. We were at the Sunshine Coast about 5 years ago and had a fantastic time but it&#039;s a long from Adelaide. Not sure when we&#039;ll make it again.
It&#039;s wonderful when children can have experiences which are educational and fun.
Blessings,
Paula]]></description>
