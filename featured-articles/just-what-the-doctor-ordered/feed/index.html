		<description><![CDATA[[...] How Mums Deal With Sick Kids Thursday 04 November 2010 ShareWe have had a week of sickness, with both kids battling a raging fever followed by sniffles and the kind of cough that makes other mums raise their eyebrows. The thermometer is in constant use, and the infant paracetamol is getting a workout too. I think we&#8217;re through the worst of it now, with only the cough hanging on, but I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye on the little man as he is prone to ear infections. [...] ]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am glad to hear your little man is on the mend. Almost the same thing happened with my small boy - I put grumbles and a slight fever down to the several teeth that were all erupting at once and we ended up going from the medical centre via an ambulance to the hospital! He had a raging fever and ear infection and I too had the horrible guilts for days. But with loads of love and cuddles, he recovered from the whole scary incident before I did! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks everyone for your encouragement and kind thoughts.  I think mummy-guilt strikes us all! As DJ said, living in guilt just robs us of our joy.  Today I choose to be a joyful mama :)  Antiobiotics are doing their job, little man is smiling again and sleeping at night - which means tonight I might sleep too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey sweetie!  Momhood can come with immense guilt if we let it.  Don&#039;t live in guilt, it will just rob your joy!  Keep loving and taking care of your babies as best you can.  If at the end of the day, they have been loved and the basic needs are met then you are doing a smash up job!

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s never easy being a parent. But, thanks to the Twitterverse, you were reminded that you did the right thing by taking him to the doctor and getting the treatment. I&#039;m stunned by how many people don&#039;t even bother to do that (or sadly, can&#039;t afford to). Hopefully the treatment will kick in and he will feel better soon (you too!)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hugs. I know you feel  lousy but it&#039;s not your fault. It could still be teething, middle ear infections are sneaky. One minute there is nothing and then wham!

I always found that my kids had otitis media when they were teething, more often that  when they were not.

I hope you BOTH feel better soon.]]></description>

He&#039;s lucky and Blessed to have you even notice he had a low grade infection, ear infections are the worst, and they always happen at 11.37pm, precisly the time your feet lift off the floor to climb into bed.  hugs, this too, shall pass.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry your little one is sick.

I think the guilt is delivered with the placenta, and never really leaves us mums.  In fact there is so much guilt in pregnancy too (what to avoid, what to eat etc) that it must come even sooner!!!]]></description>
