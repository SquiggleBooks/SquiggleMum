		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath

This one is out of a Kids Cook book and has the recipe for its own tomato sauce if you would like it as well.

225g self raising flour
55g butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
7-8 tablespoons of milk

Rub the flour, salt and butter together. (Lily would be good at that!)

When the mixture looks like breadcrumbs add the milk and stir everything together into a smooth ball of dough.

Cut the dough into 4 and roll each into a ball, then roll these out into circles about 13cm across.

Add toppings and bake for 15-20mins]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Okay then I will.

7g dry yeast
pinch salt
tsp sugar
tlbspn oil
2 cups plain flour (I use 1 cup plain white, 1 cup plain wholemeal)
200mls tepid water (warm to cool)

Place water yeast sugar and salt in a container mix together cover and leave for 7 minutes.

put flour in mixing bowl (I use mix master with kneading hooks, but you can do it by hand)

When the yeast mixture is frothy add oil

add wet mixture to flour.  Mix well knead for 4 mins if using mix master or 8 minutes on lightly floured bench.  Kids love to have a small bit to do too.

Leave covered for 20 mins (I never do)  Roll out to use.  This makes 1 very large thin to medium pizza or 2 small pizza bases.

Add toppings and cook for 20mins in a mod-hot oven.

Yum.  It takes a few times to get it right so dont give up,  this dough is also really nice to fill with ham and cheese  or what ever and plat to make a pull apart like at the bakery.]]></description>
