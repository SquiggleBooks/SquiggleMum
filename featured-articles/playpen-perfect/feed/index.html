		<description><![CDATA[I found my playpen/travel cot most useful when I had a two year old and baby.

I used the playpen for the BABY - she could doze in peace without risk of &quot;extra love&quot; in the form of kisses, hugs and being buried under a tonne of toys from her well meaning big sister!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Really made me laugh, thanks.

Reminded me of when mine tried to undo the stairgate with his toy hammer. Bang squeak, bang squeak! Sometimes nothing keeps them where you put them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, yes, thank you very much you lot!  I can see you&#039;re all sooooo sympathetic.  I have now put our portacot in the loungeroom.  It&#039;s not nearly the same, and I can only plonk him in there for very short bursts of time, but at least I can still go to the bathroom unaccompanied! LOL]]></description>
