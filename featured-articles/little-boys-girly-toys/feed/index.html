		<description><![CDATA[This made me laugh...we have 3 boys, and no girls in the home.  Somehow a couple of girl toys still snuck into our house.  When our twin boys were 2 they went through a phase where they were both obsessed with Zoe from Sesame Street.  They both carried around a Zoe doll, complete with pink tutu, for nearly a year.  My husband was so patient with them...even when they insisted on taking them in public!

		<description><![CDATA[The prams are one of the most play-with toys of my 5yo boy and 4yo girl. My boy is now in prep and he still plays with it, mostly in racing car style to race around the house. I don&#039;t have a problem with it.
I also bought him kitchen set and cooking toys before I knew my second child is going to be a girl. Cooking is a survival skill for both men and women.
I have been &#039;quietly&#039; reading your blog and loving it. Thank you for enriching my internet time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Phew! This was a great post Cath as it is something that had been on my mind as I watched Alex dress up in Amelie&#039;s fairy costume and try on her shoes and jewellery. Glad to hear that it&#039;s very normal little boy behaviour!:-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just got a copy of Raising Boys!  I have 2 sons and need all the help I can get :)

I remember hubby&#039;s dad being horrified when I sent him a photo of our youngest son dressed in a beautiful big purple tutu!  We had to re-assure him that it was perfectly normal and all would be ok!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The order of children in my family goes two boys, girl two boys.  I have noticed a pronounced difference in my thirds son propensity to role play, dress up and play with dolls compared to my older boys.  We had most of these toys available to them, but they chose not to play with them.  The third son however is very close to his sister and follows her lead and happily does all these things.  I have thought that this will actually be to his advantage, as he practices so many social and verbal skills through these games.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love this.  Made me chuckle.  My son (my fourth child) has three older sisters.  The first colour he learnt is.... you guessed it..... pink.  He loves pushing the stroller around with dolls in it and likes to try headbands on with the girls.  And yet, he is not like the girls.  As you say, he is just imitating what he sees.  I don&#039;t make an issue of it at all or tell him he can&#039;t do that sort of thing because it is for girls.  Just let little kids be little kids :D GREAT ADVICE.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heh it&#039;s funny when people say things like &quot;Oh and it doesn&#039;t mean he&#039;s gay&quot; when they see their little boy go all tunky-winky with a handbag and and heels... I&#039;m tempted to challenge them then with &quot;and what if they are gay? (or turn out to be, not sure what age anyoen can actually label their orientation)&quot;... but I don&#039;t, because I&#039;m a wuss :p (because I know that even though most people are accepting of gay/lesbian/bi/transgender etcetc if their own child was one of the above labels they still might take a lot of anjusting...)]]></description>
