So - Caleb Martin Smith]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My daughter&#039;s name is Gretchen because it&#039;s a name that I have always loved. For YEARS I loved the name and though we thought up a few others when I was pregnant, Gretchen suited her and so it was!
Her middle name is Fawn, just like mine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had trouble giving up my maiden name.  It was who I was, but I was happy to have a family name too!  Hard decisions.
We (or I, to be honest) thought that the children could have my middle name &#039;Lee&#039;.  I am Nicole Lee and Zoe is Zoe Lee.  I picked Zoe as being a teacher I wanted my kids to have common names to avoid being teased.  I figure strength in numbers.  It threw me when I found out I was having a son.  Lee is a unisex name, but I still think it is a bit girly.  So for my son I thought that I would keep the sound but go with Riley and have a different 1st name.  Originally it was going to be Mitchell.  However I was so fond of Riley that it got bumped up to first place and I went with the start of my mothers maiden name Jacob(sen) and my maiden name Max(field) for his two middle names.   That is how we came up with Zoe Lee, and Riley Jacob Max.   I think my answer is bigger than you blog Cath. Sorry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We considered meeting and how we liked the name. We didn&#039;t really consider popularity or anything else. Middle names for all three are family names, so the first name had to flow with those names.

Thanks for visiting my blog. It&#039;s fun meeting new Christian moms! :-)]]></description>
