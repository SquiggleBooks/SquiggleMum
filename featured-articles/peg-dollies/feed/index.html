		<description><![CDATA[Great idea and so cute. As we have no girls, we haven&#039;t really any dolls in the house so this is a great way for &quot;boys&quot; to get a dressing dolls fix too. My oldest loves dressing up and dressing things so he will enjoy this. He has to have sparkles though so our pegs will look a little more &quot;Chorus Line&quot;. lol]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a great Idea! I am going to try this with Airlie and let you know how we go with it. I might also show Mason who is 8 because I always worry alot that he spends too much time on the playstation or watching TV (im prob just being a worry wart) but I find myself sounding like my parents telling us to go find something to do and back in their day they didn&#039;t have all these things to keep them busy!
Great Blog Cath!
Take Care
