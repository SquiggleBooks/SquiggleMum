		<description><![CDATA[Love your idea Cath!

We use the colourful parachute.  It makes a great little house as does playibg under our big square dining table.

I once heard a good idea......make a cubby that totally covers the dining table. (top + sides) This could easily be sewn together from sturdy fabric with widows and a door added.  I&#039;d love to give this a go one day.

PS  I purchased a flower press for my girls on a visit to Bangalow this week.  This was inspired by your blog about flat out flora.  I owned a flower press as a kid and loved it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Giving a child their own little space to play in is such a lovely thing to do. I turned our clothesline into a cubby house for one of the play segments I did for Channel 10 earlier in the year. I went hunting at the local op shops and grabbed a couple of sheets for just 50 cents each. These are now our cubby house sheets and it saves washing the ones we actually use on the beds!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes it is a lovely idea! We used to have a parent hang sheets around the Hills Hoist - that made a lovely big house! We&#039;d use towels to make hallways and different rooms inside. Mum wasn&#039;t happy that we virtually emptied the linen closet but it was fun. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love this idea - so easy, yet encourages the kids to use their imagination.

My son is still playing with a huge cardboard box - last week it was a car park, today it is his swimming pool.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I live on a steep sloped back yard too, so I really love this idea.  My nephews and I normally play inside because I never know what to do with the slopey back yard - will definitely give this a go!

And I love the first comment by Angela.  I vividly remember making indoor forts, castles and tents (depending on what game we were playing).  Poor mum - her cushions were on the floor more than they were on the couches :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree, Little Houses are fabulous! A fantastic wet-weather day activity as well when you take off the couch cushions, bring in all the dining chairs, line the floor with doonas and cushions, and make a roof out of sheets. Children love it and they can be different every time to suit the needs of play!]]></description>
