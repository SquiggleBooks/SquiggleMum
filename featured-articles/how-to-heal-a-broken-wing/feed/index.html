		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath

Sounds like a book I need to get my hands on.

I can imagine the immediate thoughts that could have run through your mind when your sweet daughter said her prayer. Ahhh, the thoughts of a three year old - memorable, innocent and they can make you want to laugh and cry at the same time.

Cath, I read your previous post and thought the analogy was excellent. It makes it easier to gain perspecitve when you think about juggling glass balls, rubber balls etc. You certainly need to look after those precious glass balls and not let anything damage them.]]></description>
