		<description><![CDATA[Climbing trees in the backyard! And looking after the bantams at my Grandma&#039;s - all the cousins had one &amp; she would save eggs from &#039;our&#039; chook for us to eat when we stayed with her.
The chooks lived in an almond grove &amp; we would harvest the almonds each year. My sister &amp; I would hold the bags while Dad knocked the nuts off the trees. Yum!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have Small Fry&#039;s cook book and play book (both are great) - this is the only one I don&#039;t have. One thing that has been brought back to me as we have moved back to the country is making daisy chains. I can still sit and do it for hours! Sandra x (ps. you can win Small Fry Play over at my blog this week - can I say that?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had a black labrador dog growing up and I can remember getting home from school and walking straight out the back door into the yard every afternoon to play with her.

Another favourite memory was gathering mulberries from our neighbours had a mulberry tree. We would all end up with purple fingers (and faces) and then mum would make delicious mulberry pies (if we had any berries left over).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember looking for mud crabs under rocks by the water&#039;s edge not far from our house. Being sent outside to the garden to collect herbs for dinner, and being so careful to get the right ones! Swinging on the big slab of timber hung so rustically from the big old tree outside....]]></description>
