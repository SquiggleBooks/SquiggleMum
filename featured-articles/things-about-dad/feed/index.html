		<description><![CDATA[We do every year.  We have a collection of &#039;Dad&#039; books.  each fathers day or whenever they are given I write in the front cover.

This years reads
he reads books to me
and sings songs to me when I go to bed
he has a cup of tea
um
he plays with me so I kick him on the swing
he cuts the tree
he goes on the computer
Love Zoe.

I love putting down word for word what she says,  I have no idea where the cup of tea bit came from,  he likes tea but they dont have one together.]]></description>
