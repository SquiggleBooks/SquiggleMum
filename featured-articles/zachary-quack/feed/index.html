		<description><![CDATA[Another fantastic article, which we&#039;ve not only featured on our Cradle Fables facebook fan page, but we&#039;ve decided to launch a competition based around your idea!

Hairy Maclary is definitely a favourite for my nephews, too.  Although it&#039;s usually me that is the one quoting lines to them and often calling them names like &quot;Isaac Maclary from Donaldson&#039;s dairy&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are big lovers of hairy maclary here. Noah knows all the words and can quote many of them back, often at inappropriate times, like in the supermarket bread isle, just when there is a second of silence.

Imagine doing the scarface claw yowl right about then.

Yeah.

I love you Zachary Quack]]></description>
