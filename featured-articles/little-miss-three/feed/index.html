		<description><![CDATA[I know how you feel! I had this feeling back in Feb with my &#039;baby&#039; (at the time) turning 3, and I must say in the last 3 months I have noticed he is a &#039;real little boy&#039; now and I can see he is growing up.  Like you, I&#039;m a believer in embracing the moment.  They don&#039;t stay &#039;little&#039; for long.  Happy Birthday to your little girl and the cake shape looks perfect!]]></description>
