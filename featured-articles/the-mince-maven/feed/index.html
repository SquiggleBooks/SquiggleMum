		<description><![CDATA[I too have had many experiments with &#039;mince many ways&#039;!!  I also do home made sausage rolls with mince... I usually hide grated carrot, pumpkin and peas in mine, and gravox for the sauce to hold it all together.  Then just wrap in puff pastry and you&#039;re done!  I&#039;ve also found you can hide lentils in them...just use a standard soup mix, and leave them soaking in boiled water all day til they&#039;re soft and soggy.  It it wrong that I&#039;m not even a mother and I still hide vegies!?!]]></description>
