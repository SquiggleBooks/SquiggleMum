		<description><![CDATA[What a great post!

I read to my son from the day he was born (he&#039;s now almost 3), and by the end of each day he&#039;s generally had at least 10 books read to him - most of them on his request.  He can sit and concentrate on books for as long as anyone is willing to read them to him.

But I&#039;ve found that I often get caught up in my day and don&#039;t put aside the one-on-one time to read with my 11 month old daughter.  The difference between the two is huge!  When I do sit down to read to her she wiggles and squirms and loses interest fast!  And she doesn&#039;t &quot;play&quot; with books on her own the way my son often did.  Difference in personality might have a little to do with it too, but your post has reminded me that I&#039;m really going to have to make more of a concerted effort to read to her every day.  Thank-you!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,
It&#039;s great to meet you. I found you through Narelle&#039;s and Janet&#039;s blogs and then noticed you&#039;re already a follower of mine. That&#039;s great.
I have a 5yo boy who I&#039;m teaching to read so thanks for this interesting post. His brother was an automatic bookworm and his sister learned fairly easily, but he seems to be more of an action oriented person. But we probably have read 1000 stories, so it makes me feel we&#039;re on the right track.
Blessings,
Paula]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love hearing about other people reading to their kids.
I have read to all 3 of my kids from about 9 months. The oldest and youngest are boys and they love it just as much as my daughter.
My (eldest) 5 year old actually picks a lot of his sister&#039;s books for bedtime reading. He hates pink and won&#039;t participate in &quot;girly&quot; play but he quite often picks her &quot;Very Very Pearly&quot; book or other fairy books.
I&#039;m sure this will become uncool too but I&#039;m encouraging it for as long as possible.

I buy them all kinds of books to share. They are only her books because she got them as gifts.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post.  My daughter has always loved books - but we have struggled with my 18month old son. We kept persisting - even if we only read a few pages before he struggled to get down. But it has paid off - he loves his books now - bringing his favourites to be read throughout the day!  He even sits on his little couch and has a look himself now.  He especially loves the ones where you have to open little tabs to find something.  I am so glad that we kept up - it would have been easy just to say that he isn&#039;t interested like his big sis was...]]></description>
