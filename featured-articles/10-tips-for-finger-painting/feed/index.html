		<description><![CDATA[oh we loooooooove finger painting!

Find a nice big sheet of plastic and tape it to the table top then finger paint right onto that - take a &#039;print&#039; with paper if you like. Clean up is easy cause you can just take off the plastic and whisk it away.

Add a squirt of liquid soap to whatever paint you use also makes clean up easy!]]></description>
