		<description><![CDATA[Hi

We did a similar activity this week only we used macaroni and food dye.

I pulled a couple of pages out of a colouring in book Zoe spread it with pva glue and stuck the macaroni on a couple at a time.  This activity is great as it takes a lot longer than just colouring in.  Fun too.

Next week I think the craft cups will be filled with colourful salt.]]></description>
