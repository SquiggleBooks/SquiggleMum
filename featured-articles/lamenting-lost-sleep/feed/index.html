		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been dealing with this the past couple of months as well. My problem is that my two year old (three at the end of July) won&#039;t stay in his room. I think he needs the nap since he&#039;s aggressive and awful when he gets too tired. And like you I need an hour with Dr. Phil everyday!
The other thing though is that when he does sleep in the day it&#039;s starting to mean he&#039;s awake until 10pm which is much worse. Think we&#039;ll have to say bye-bye to naps and have quiet rest time instead.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was reading this entry and nodding the whole way through. It is challenging when they go through these transitional phases. Alex is doing that at the moment - transitioning from 2 day sleeps to 1. It is a privelege to be able to watch them grow and change, though isn&#039;t it!]]></description>
