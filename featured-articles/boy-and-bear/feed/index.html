		<description><![CDATA[Tedda and Buddy (Silly Buddy) were the original snuggle friends for Miss M but they have been taken over now by new teddies that have been given since.  Jesse Bear and teddy (original name huh!)are the new special bears on the block.  I will post a photo on my blog for you to see.  Miss M was given teddy in a package last week.  A friend saw this picture of Miss M and teddy on fb and kindly did some photo shop art to it.

Cute post Catherine!  There&#039;s nothing like Pooh poetry.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Both of my twins have bunnies that are essential to life apparently.  We refer to Clover&#039;s bunny as SRT (Stinky Rabbit Thing) and it bears the blood stains from the many trips to the hospital with her tiny mistress.  Clover crawls with SRT in her mouth.  She does not yet say many words, so we have taught her the sign for bunny. She will look around for her stuffed friend and then start waving her hands on top of her head to tell us what she is missing.

We have 3 of SRT.  An heir and a spare to the original.

We have 3 of Kieran&#039;s Bun.E as well.

I think the bear is sweet.  He looks like a good buddy.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son has &#039;Brown Teddy&#039; whom he loves devotedly and always sleeps with.  We move heaven and earth to find teddy at the end of the day.  How I wish we had 2 the same and could substitute.  And I&#039;m grateful that I established when my son was about 2 that Teddy does not visit - sometimes he is allowed to stay in the car or come to the doctor for moral support.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My daughter has a few on rotation, lol!
She will love &quot;Sizzles&quot; the dog for awhile then its &quot;Lily&#039;s&quot; turn and so forth.
But when she was younger (around 10 months) she had a newborn Cabbage Path Baby called Leah that she took *everywhere*. Leah was a favourite untill she was about 2 and 1/2.
