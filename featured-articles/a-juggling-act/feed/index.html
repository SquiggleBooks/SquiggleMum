		<description><![CDATA[This morning I feel exhausted - but reading this  over a cup of coffee(&amp; after my less than satisfying six hours sleep!!) makes me feel better, and more understood.

Sometimes you can feel all alone in your attempts to perfect the juggling act. Work is calling, the house is a mess, the garden needs weeding. So many things call out for attention - sometimes you feel like a mouse racing around in the middle of one of those little wheels!

This weekend I am going to make a point of polishing the little glass balls in my life with lots of love and focussed attention.

After the sheets and towels have made been washed and hung out. Promise.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[when the children grow into adults a mother still juggles her balls.  Often she is the only person who realises this, but to her they are still &#039;glass balls&#039;. Because she has been juggling all her parenting life, she is able to add &#039;son-in-law&#039; balls and &#039;grandchildren&#039; balls when the time comes.  A mother who chooses to juggle many glass balls is a blessing to the world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[christie referred me to your blog in my blog&#039;s comment section today, after i wrote about finding the balance in life...and how tough it can get.

It&#039;s a great analogy..and I particularly like the part when it says my hubby deserves the best of me, not what&#039;s left of me at 11.30pm.

Thanks for sharing! we moms sure do face similar challenges each day, don&#039;t we? ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My recent break from blogging definitely clarified my blog&#039;s place in the grand scheme of things... it is really not very important at all.
As it seems I am about to embark on full-time employment, my glass balls seem even more precious and I will be juggling with complete care and dedication.
I love the analogy... great post. xx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Bobo, your circus is travelling along just fine.  Even if the monkey destroyed his cage and the trapeze artists wobbly does not land quite on the mat.  (just trying to stick with the theme hehehe)

I love what Keri wrote, speaks loud and clear to me too!  A couple of years ago I had so many lead balls to juggle; once I got rid of those my glass balls got bigger and I am so much happier.]]></description>
