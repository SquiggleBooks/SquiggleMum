		<description><![CDATA[Hi Christie. we relocated to Perth from Adelaide 4 mths ago &amp; I totally agree with you in that Perth has a lot to offer in terms of the great outdoors.  Many more open spaces from parks to beaches which cater for young families. We are enjoying our time here &amp; look fw to the warmer weather approaching. I had to give up work when we moved across as we chose not to put our three yr old into childcare as she was being cared for by family whilst I worked in Adelaide. As much as I miss the adult interaction &amp; mental stimulation of the workplace I am truly making the most of my time with my little girl before she starts school on 2011.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Cath and Kate for your kind words.

Nicole, if you are passionate about sharing your story then you should definitely give blogging a go.  It does take time and commitment to grow but its great fun and you meet wonderful people along the way.
