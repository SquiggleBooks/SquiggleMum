		<description><![CDATA[Great!  My boys love to draw!  I went to the local newspaper just last week and got an endroll.  We&#039;ve been rolling it out on the floor and down the hall.  Coloring, drawing &quot;dream house&quot; plans, tracing bodies and then drawing faces and clothes on them.  We have had a blast!!!!!!  Now I need to try different mediums to draw with.  Thanks for all of the ideas.]]></description>
