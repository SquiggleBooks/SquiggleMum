		<description><![CDATA[We love taking the high chair outside. Ours is one of those chairs that you can lower so, I put it at a height so bubs can join us for morning tea or lunch at the small table.  I have to be honest and even though I know it is good for them to be outdoors, a big driver for me is the mess factor.  So much easier to leave the crumbs for the birds. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We love taking the high chair outside for meals too and I am so glad that we are finally seeing some Spring weather in Perth, perfect for eating outside.

Tiff, Immy was and still is, obsessed by pegs too!

P.S. I love your P.S. and P.P.S. notes, made me laugh!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We use the lift and lock swing for the same reasons although it would be great if it had a tray.  Would love to take the highchair outside but I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s a bit too heavy to take downstairs.  I&#039;d die trying!!!!  It&#039;s a really great idea though Catherine!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ivy and Noah had lots of outside time, in the highchair, on the ground, in swings while I pegged out washing ( Dave strung them up on our verandah, and a washing line there too)it was wonderful, especially when I was in the thick of postnatal depression, it was nice to get outside). I loved outside time with them. They were fascinated with everything but their favourite thing was the pegs. They would spend ages putting the pegs in the peg bucket (they still love this when I am hanging the washing out, although now, it is more about sorting colours and lining things up for Ivy and roleplaying for Noah).
Your posts bring back such nice memories for me and make just a little bit clucky!]]></description>
