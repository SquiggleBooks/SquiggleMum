		<description><![CDATA[We have always taught our kids that books are precious.  That said, to really develop that early bonding with books, we have taken the approach that &#039;baby friendly&#039; books - you know the ones, thick cardboard or plastic - teach the child to know books, then constantly reading to them teaches them to love books.

As they grow, the books change and then respect for the books (no sucking, chewing or ripping) is reinforced.

Hopefully it means that through life their appreciation for books will continue :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link Cath.

I agree that books are special and to be respected, as are all our belongings, but I would always want them to be accessible to Immy everyday (and in our case in pretty much every room), I have however, always emphasised that books weren&#039;t to go in mouths (just like many other items in everyday life in and out and about the house).  I was lucky that Immy picked up on that message it hasn&#039;t been a problem for us.

		<description><![CDATA[This reminded me of the day I took my three kids (5.5 and twin 1.5 year) to a book store to purchase a birthday gift. I wanted to focus on my oldest so I gave the babies a couple of board books off the rack and began browsing the collection for a gift. I thought they were way past the mouthing stage, so imagine my horror when the salesperson asked if I was going to buy the books they were eating! They were both sitting there with board books in their mouths. Needless to say I did buy them, the gift, and a book for the oldest, too (everyone else was getting one, why shouldn&#039;t she?). That ended up being an expensive gift! They haven&#039;t (of course) chewed on a book since, and I really think it was because they hadn&#039;t seen those books before...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think that having a firm rule not to mouth or step on/pull on books is hard to enforce unless you put books out of reach.  I&#039;d rather my child have access to books and allow some mouthing etc (I put board books, cloth books in easy reach and others higher on the shelf).  Then, as my children grow up I&#039;ll teach them how to look after books, as well as their other toys]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love Kelly&#039;s comments...

Books are like any other possession - children will learn to love and care for them as they grow. There will be mishaps along the way, that is one way we learn. There will be times when you put away some special books or only allow them to be looked at together as you learn how to look after them, but not allowing a small child to freely interact with some books (chewing and all) I think means they are missing out on learning opportunities.

In our house books are no more or less special than other good toy or item, we expect them to be used and worn out with love.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[From Facebook:
Cradle Fables

Great article, Catherine. It was interesting to read all the comments too. Personally, I would recommend cloth books for babies which are designed for them to rip at, chew and spit up on with no damage to baby or the book. At a certain age babies will put anything and everything in their mouths!

While reading to baby I recommend holding the picture book at a certain distance so they can see the illustrations but can&#039;t reach. Read a book with enthusiasm and the baby will be just as fascinated by you as they are the object in front of them that they want to chomp on :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The bottom shelf in the playroom is full of cloth books and board books that are a free for all.  If my kids eat them well I will just cut back on the prunes that day, hehehe

Our main book shelves are more in view,  at the bottom are the larger board books and ones that are favourites like spot, maisy and all the other lift the flap books,  Mister almost 1 can get his hands on these, and usually brings me a few to read.  Miss three&#039;s books are the next shelf up but I made them in tight that it is hard for mister almost 1 to pull them out.   The really special books are up higher that Mister almost 1 can not get and Miss 3 knows only to get out when he is asleep.  We only have a few books that are not replaceable they are away.  Why tempt them.    The library books have a place of their own,  I dont want to be paying for replacements.  We also have a handful of books in each bedroom.  As you might have guessed we love books.  They are in the car too!   Oh and a lovely collection in the bath tub.    Books are to be enjoyed at every age and stage of development.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Kelly, pick your battles! I too am book mad and have lots of shelves full of books all over our home. This means I have had to teach Amy that books are special and not to be thrown around, eaten, coloured in or taken outside and left there. She has chewed on a few of the hard board books when she was younger but now she loves her book collection and will often be found asleep in bed at night cuddling a book.]]></description>
