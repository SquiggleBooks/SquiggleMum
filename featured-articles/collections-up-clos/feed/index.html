		<description><![CDATA[I love the case Cath.  What a lovely way to display all the interesting and very special discoveries.  Don&#039;t you just love the odd things you find on ebay or in cheap shops and op shops, then later find a great use for them. What treasure!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My girls got magnifying glasses for Christmas last year - I figured they were a small easy and fun gift to give as we were away camping. They have been the best few dollars ever spent - hours of fun!
Totally LOVE your sorting tray - had something similar when I was teaching, so many things you can use it for!]]></description>
