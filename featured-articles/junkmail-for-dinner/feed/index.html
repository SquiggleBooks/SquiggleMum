		<description><![CDATA[My kids used to do this too. As they get older, you can use this to help them withe their number skills by looking at the foods with certain prices. My grade 2 boy now gets given &quot;money&quot; to go &quot;shopping&quot; with in the catalogues &amp; cuts out the items he wants that he can afford.

Love the paper plate idea :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We used to do that too! (They think they are too old for it now...) We also use old magazines for that kind of thing. You can also get them to find pictures of things beginning with a particular letter - it can be harder than they think. Good rainy day fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[WOW - thanks everyone for your comments.  You know I almost didn&#039;t post this idea, thinking it was a bit ordinary!  It&#039;s funny how the simple, cost-free ideas attract so much interest, even if the final product isn&#039;t a gorgeous piece of art for the wall.  I love that you all appreciate that process is so much more important than the finished product when it comes to toddler activities!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a great idea!! Wow Cath, where do you get them from. You should compile a book of all these fantastic, cheap, fun ideas for kids.
I&#039;m almost tempted to pull down our &quot;No Junk Mail&quot; sign so we can have some fun with this one. :-)]]></description>
