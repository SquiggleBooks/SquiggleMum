		<description><![CDATA[Love this idea - would never have thought of it.

Giving my blog a bit of a spring clean - would love your opinion - it is nearly finished, just a wee bit more tweaking which a bloggy friend is helping with.

Also planning to reveal my kitchen makeover tomorrow - finally done!]]></description>
