		<description><![CDATA[The endpaper forest in &#039;Where&#039;s My Teddy&#039; sets the scene for this wonderfully engaging tale. We LOVE this book!  It&#039;s a little bit scary but it draws us in evry time, right from the deep dark forest picture.

&#039;Tea For Ruby&#039; written by Sarah Ferguson, The Dutchess of York has a beautifully illustrated print both front and back but the best part is the hand written thank you note from Ruby to her Grandma on the back endpaper.  A lovely way to end a lovely story.

Oh, and who could go past the beautiful colours in the very well known story of&#039;The Very Hungry Caterpillar&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I like the endpapers in We&#039;re Going on a Bear Hunt by Michael Rosen which show a beach, and the back paper has the bear walking home forlornly, not having caught anything.
I&#039;m definitely going to be looking at the endpapers more often now that you&#039;ve mentioned it.]]></description>
