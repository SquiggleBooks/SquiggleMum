		<description><![CDATA[Hello, Cath
You have a wonderful blog keep up the great work. I am not a mom though I am a dad, regardless the subjects that you talk about hit the spot when it comes to parenting and all the fun adventures that go with it. I have been trying to get my wife to do what you are doing here for quite some time. Of course she is a mom as well but also she has another point of view other than just being a mom she is a social worker and is a licensed LCSW family therapist. Well enough from me, great site I like hat you are doing because being a mom is perhaps one of the most important jobs in the world.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Am TOTALLY impressed with your blog.  I just started mine two months ago - more focused on the writing than the blogging.  Also wondering where it will go - but extremely intimidated by the tech and setting up a whole website, which is the direction planned.  And the time networking.  Unfortunately I am one of those who needs to sleep.  Big bummer.  BUt - you founde ME through the 31 BBB challenge and now I&#039;ve found you - so it&#039;s a start.  LOVE YOUR WRITING!]]></description>
