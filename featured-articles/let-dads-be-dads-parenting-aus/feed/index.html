		<description><![CDATA[I often overhear my kids saying to hubby &#039;that&#039;s not how mummy does it.&#039; Hubby and I both now have a standard answer to that, &#039;mummy does it her way and daddy does it his way, neither way is right or wrong, just different!&#039;

Our boys are old enough to understand that and the reply helps me too; it&#039;s true! - I&#039;ve chilled out so much as far as this area of parenting is concerned, I used to feel that everything had to be done my way!!

Thanks for the post Cath :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[awesome blogs Cath, you&#039;re giving me plenty to think about and consider before I have my own kids.  I feel I&#039;ll be heaps more prepared when I do (though I&#039;m sure it&#039;ll still be a steep learning curve!)]]></description>
