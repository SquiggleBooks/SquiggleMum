		<description><![CDATA[@ Shantanu.  Thanks for your comment!  Will check out your blog too ;)

I recently reskinned my blog and am really happy with the look... except that I can&#039;t seem to get this skin to support the archive widget!  Tried adding the calendar but I know it&#039;s a poor substitute.  Think I&#039;d better investigate further.  Thanks for your feedback.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,

I came here from Problogger, am participating in the 31DBBB too..

You have a wonderful website and if possible I&#039;ll link to some of your posts from my blog..

Keep up the good work... By the way, why don&#039;t you put an archives widget in your sidebar?

Keep writing...

Best.

		<description><![CDATA[I opted for the hardboiled, food dyed approach this year... it was easy, but they don&#039;t look as pretty as your eggs! And I felt bad wasting so many eggs. It&#039;s definitely a great Easter activity for the kids though. :-)]]></description>
