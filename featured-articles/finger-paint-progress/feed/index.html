		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with u MissyBoo, our daughter will be four next month &amp; enjoys painting but it doesn&#039;t look as good as Cath&#039; daughter artwork. Our munchkin produces lots of coloured splodges overlapping each other. We tell her it looks like wonderful but I must say she forms a fantastic handprint!! Will make a point in asking her what she is thinking when painting next time. thanks...]]></description>
