		<description><![CDATA[I saw some lovely children&#039;s gumboots recently at Gleam O&#039;Dawn, Mt Glorious Rd Samford.  They were more heavy duty than the usual kiddy gumboots so perfect if your child is a chronic outdoor kid or if they are to be used in tougher surrounds such as sloping ground or heaps of mud.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sure!  The gumboots were from Cocoon at Paddington, and the raincoat was a luck find at Pumpkin Patch.  I also saw some cool strippy boots in both blue(keeping in mind for when Reuben is a similar age) and pink on mykeiko.com.au with matching raincoats.  There was also an umbrella, but I don&#039;t think it lasted beyond Christmas Day!!  It was Kiddorable from Peter&#039;s of Kengsington.  Hope this helps!  And good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good fun hey! Ella (almost 4 yo) out there y&#039;day nudey rudey in the rain, just a pink umbrella between her and the elements and loving every minute of it. Can I ask where the raincoat and gumboots from? Ella asking for some for her upcoming bday (would have to be pink to match umbrella of course). Avoiding the shops as much as possible these days (too much temptation - not enough money) so lose track of where to get the good stuff. Perhaps the &#039;favourite aunty&#039; could reveal her source and save me some tracking down time. Would be very appreciative. Thanks Cath and thanks for making time to write too. PS Did you get in touch with Nat M (Maroochydore MBC MOPS)?]]></description>
