		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath

It&#039;s not next year for us, but the year after that my youngest starts kindy. My husband already jokes about the tears - my tears!!! I am in the very fortunate position of being able to care of our children at home seven days a week. Our weeks are filled with playgroup, music class, play dates and spending time together playing, laughing, cuddling and crafting.

I think it will certainly be a lot harder for me than it will for our children when I send them off to be under somebody elses care (which will be when they go to kindy).

Before becoming a SAHM, I was a secondary school teacher for ten years and completely agree with the comments you made about forming a productive relationship with your children&#039;s teacher.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh my baby (2nd son) is off to school for 2.5 days a week next year and I&#039;m so not ready to let him go, I get teary even typing about it!  So many of my friends can&#039;t wait for their children to go to school I feel like I&#039;m in the minority.  He&#039;s always been home with me, I&#039;ve never even used day care for him!!

Thanks for the article.  There are many things we&#039;ve already tackled as our Mr 7 has been in school for 4 years now, but I need to prepare myself to say goodbye to Mr 3 :)

Just want to say that I love your blog and always feel encouraged and inspired by you.  Thanks :)

Blessings and Love
Narelle
