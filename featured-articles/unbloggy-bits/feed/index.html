		<description><![CDATA[really? you mean your life isn&#039;t all cup cakes and craft projects? But I am so disapointed..... LOL
I think that is really the whole point of &#039;personal&#039; blogging - you blog what feels right to you at the time. Happy, Sad, in between.. who cares. If you don&#039;t like it, don&#039;t read it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Cath. It comes back to that great old saying &quot;If you haven&#039;t got anything nice to say...&quot;
Any mum who is making an effort, taking time out of her insanely busy life to blog, should be celebrated. :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now I am wondering &#039;what brought this on&quot; but hey, I am always happy to unload crap off my chest too.  People say I am always positive, but that&#039;s because I choose to post stuff like that, trust me, there are many days when I am not feeling that way at all, it&#039;s ok.

I know myself, I trust myself, I accept and forgive myself, it&#039;s all good.

Thankyou for also pointing out that you are human, and have a lovely un-bloggy day.  xxx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love what you have written in this Post. Just the other day I blogged about a beautiful time I had with my son at the park. I went home and that evening, I was stressed and cranky and I thought.... I hope I don&#039;t seem like a hypocrite! I not always a fantastic Mum, I often have to say sorry to my children and my life is not all rosy! As you say, it is just a positive snipit. Mostly life is un-bloggy ay.

Thanks Cath....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well said! I just don&#039;t get why Mums need to criticise each other, whether it be blogs, what we do with our kids or if we are a SAHM or Working Mum. Can&#039;t we all just get along and be happy if our kids are well loved, fed and sheltered?]]></description>
