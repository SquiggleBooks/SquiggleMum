		<description><![CDATA[Great site. I&#039;ve bought a Garden friends Gift Set. It&#039;s just gorgeous and to think that these cards are better for the planet at the same time!!! I can&#039;t wait to write my notes to the school teacher on nice paper instead of the scraps I usually find!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s the recipe for all you spaghetti lovers -
Ingredients: 1kg beef mince, 1 diced onion, 1 tsp minced garlic, 1 tsp dried Italian herbs, 1 large grated carrot, 1 large grated zucchini, 2 cups finely chopped mushrooms, 1/4 cup tomato paste, 2 cans diced tomatoes, 1 cup beef stock, 1 500g bottle pasta sauce, 1/4 cup grated cheese.
Method: brown the mince, onion and garlic. Add the tomato paste, herbs and other veggies and cook for about 3-5 minutes until veggies are soft &amp; golden. Add the 2 cans of tomatoes and beef stock and simmer uncovered for about 20 minutes until reduced. Add the pasta sauce about 2 minutes before serving to make a nice consistency. Serve with spaghetti and sprinkle with cheese! This feeds my family of 5 for two meals. Try making a lasagne with the leftovers for something different!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ditto request for the spaghetti recipe. I&#039;m always looking for ways to sneak in veggies, and I agree on the card economics. The prices they&#039;re charging these days for a cookie cutter card...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for bringing us Janelle and her gorgeous cards and writing sets at &#039;Earth &amp; Ink&#039;. As someone who is always aghast at the cost of a card I will certainly be shopping here!
PS I&#039;d love her bolognese sauce recipe if she drops by and wants to post it in the comments. :-D]]></description>
