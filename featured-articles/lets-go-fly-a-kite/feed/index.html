		<description><![CDATA[Actually, from memory I think our kites were so complex that very few of them actually flew!!  I think mine was a diamond/double pyramid shape.  I do remember it was red and yellow.  And no, it didn&#039;t fly!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When we lived in Bristol we flew kits a lot on the Downs, and there was a great kite fesitval there too.

Here we tend to fly them on Portstewart strand - but have not yet done it this year. Thanks for the inspiration.  A great way to tire out active kids!]]></description>
