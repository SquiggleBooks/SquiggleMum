		<description><![CDATA[My youngest loves to play Jack in the Box, and the last box he made into a boat, then a submarine - he stuck buttons and plastic plates to is for the controls.

My older girls don&#039;t play with big boxes anymore, but enjoy decorating shoe boxes to make homes and hotels for their soft toys.

George, the cat, is probably our biggest fan of cardboard boxes - he will try to sit in one, no matter how small it is!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My 9 and 11 year olds still love playing with boxes.  The box from our new tv became a house complete with door, windows, letterbox (smaller box added to big box) and a light (small torch taped to the ceiling of the box/house).

I have a large box full of MOPS bags for conference which my 11 year old keeps asking me when I&#039;ll be finished with it!!  Not sure what she is planning but I&#039;m sure it will be interesting.

I agree the humble box is the best and cheapest toy ever.]]></description>
