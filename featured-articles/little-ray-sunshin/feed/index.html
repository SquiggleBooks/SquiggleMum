		<description><![CDATA[I hear you loud and clear Christie.  With skin cancer on both sides of the family we are very conscious of sun safety (as you can see by the pic). I just don&#039;t think we need to hide bubs away inside!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Alison - sunshine certainly lifts my mood.

When I worked in child care we worked so hard to communicate the &#039;Slip Slop Slap&#039; message, with regards to sunscreen, hats for all outdoor play and suitable clothing.  I understand the concern about Vitamin D but worry that we will just muddy the waters when it comes to parents being provided enough/correct information about making choices with concerns to safe sun play.  A bit like the question of how much is okay when it comes to alcohol and pregnancy or alcohol and breastfeeding.

I think you said it best here Cath;
&quot;while it is imperative that we still slip, slop, slap and stay out of the sun during the hottest parts of the day, our kids literally need sunlight on their skin for healthy growth and development&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used to bath the girls outside in their baby bath when they were small. The older girls are twins so one used to get naked tummy time while the other was having a bath.
Sunshine is important for bubs - and for mums, too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Swimming in a clam shell pool.  Fill with warm water from the tap. Sit under a beach umbrella = lots of fun outdoors. The kids go in and out of the shade.  Plenty of rays on sunny days.  :D

I love the photo of R:D]]></description>
