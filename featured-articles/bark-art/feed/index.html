		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath!  Thanks for stopping by at my page and &#039;following&#039; me.  I love this idea of bark painting.  There is a park not far from my house where a few trees lose bark, so next time I&#039;m down there I will definitely get some for my daughter to paint!  I look forward to keeping up with your page.  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great activity and very low cost too!  Reminds me of when I was in year 7, we did a similar thing. A whole month of bark art, knowing now what I know about school budgets it was possibly our teachers way of making the art materials last longer. :P]]></description>
