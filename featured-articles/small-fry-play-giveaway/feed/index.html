		<description><![CDATA[Hi there
I once put blobs of different coloured paints on a table (child&#039;s craft table) and covered the paint in contact, so that the paint was in a little bubble. The kids pushed the paint around through the contact to create patterns, swirls, pictures, letters. Great fun, and a little less  mess than finger painting. Not that there&#039;s anything wrong with mess!]]></description>

One of his favourite activities is to balance on a plank of wood held up at both ends by bricks (the higher the better!)

		<description><![CDATA[My kids will occupy themselves for half an hour or more making mud stew, complete with grass, dirt, clover and rocks from the garden. I put the stop sign up when they come inside looking for samples from the pantry and tell them to stick with what they can find outdoors! Needless to say, when they&#039;re done &#039;cooking&#039; its straight to the bath :)]]></description>
