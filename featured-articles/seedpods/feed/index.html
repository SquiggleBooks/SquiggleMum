		<description><![CDATA[Love this post Catherine!  You must live in a terrific place to be able to collect so many varieties of seed pods.

I had to giggle that both our most recent posts stated that we were having a &quot;much needed&quot; day at home.  A busy but great week for you too?  Lovely to end the week this way! *sigh*]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cath,
what a delightful post!  My two children and i have a nature collection which includes some of the funkiest seed pods i&#039;ve ever seen.  Some were collected by me as a child.

don&#039;t forget to talk to your children about the fact that with trees, what you see above, you generally find below.  that is, the roots of a tree mimics its branch structure.  interesting huh?!

		<description><![CDATA[Oh can&#039;t wait to see your painted seeds... have seen the more gorgeous painted gum leaves!
So jealous of your great variety of seed pods... pretty much all we have here is gum nuts. But I&#039;m sure I&#039;ve seen a paper aeroplane version of those twirly seeds somewhere, which might be fun for those of us who are twirly seed deprived!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful,   the Tipuana Tipu seeds look like the litte twitter bird at the top of your blog.  Are you able to paint these or are they a bit delicate?

You really do live up to your description of Ideas and inspiration,  while I go and rake our yard everyday at the moment you find the beauty in what falls on it and create a wonderful activity.  Thanks for sharing Cath.]]></description>
