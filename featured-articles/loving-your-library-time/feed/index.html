		<description><![CDATA[Love the tip about starting at A and looking through the books a bit more systematically, from A-Z.  I tend to be a bit hit and miss, attracted by the covers and drawn to books I know from my teaching time.

		<description><![CDATA[Just because I saw the Dr Seus, Erin&#039;s favorite book is Horton Hears a Who. We don&#039;t read it as such, mostly we just look at the pictures and turn (crumple) the pages.

I agree about letting kids have their own library cards. Erin&#039;s only two and she has one. She &quot;helps&quot; me borrow the books and put them in our bag. Our library has a big empty kids section (with a computer that we love) so she plays while I look at books, sometimes she&#039;ll bring me books off the display shelf and as long as they&#039;re not too wordy we borrow those too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love the library, well not just one.  They all have something different to offer.  Story time with craft for my 3 year old on a Friday,  Babies Books and Rhymes on a Tuesday or going to the State Library any day.  It always has wonderful actvities on for the kids.  Chermside has a boat to sit in and read books,  Mt Ommaney has a cubby house.  Our local library has a huge park outside.  We have been known to make use of all our cards in our house bringing home up to 60 books, (especially when moving).  We bring home the crappy ones aswell and then talk about why they are not so good.   I let Zoe choose books but before it goes into the bag she has to sit look over it and tell me what she thinks it will be about...very intreresting what she thinks sometimes.  I love the library, I used it for all of my pregnancy books, baby food books etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Squigglemum!

We love our library but its quite small, we lost our former library in cyclone Larry and our temporary one has a very small children&#039;s area, so we don&#039;t use it as much as we used to.  We are however currently campaigning for a better library and I&#039;m hoping to get the kids involved in this process too.

We love playing libraries at home too, my eldest is 8 and he makes librarian badges and library cards and set up different sections for games, puzzles, fiction &amp; non-fiction and even themed areas (dinosaurs &amp; Australian animals usually feature at our place)

		<description><![CDATA[I tried using the library but with two of them it was a case of &quot;chase me&quot; &quot;no chase me&#039; ...both running different directions out the auto matic door - leading to a huge flight of tiled stairs a few metres away.

I will try again with my husband helping I think.

We have a hundred books (maybe 200) gifts, or more collected , passed down (from MR 16)and found at school fete (hwole box for $1).Some are not particularly good but colourful and I make my words up.

I found your ideas on choice of books very informative - thank you.]]></description>
