		<description><![CDATA[What a great article to read..... I feel so happy to be a mother too.  Although can be overwhelming at times! But yes, my heart is full to bursting with adoration for them and I love that feeling. I received a hand made mothers day card from our eldest daughter which I will treasure forever!
Happy parenting LOL]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy Mother&#039;s Day to you as well!

It truly is the most amazing thing ever, to be a mom. That in itself is a gift unlike nothing else.

I&#039;m thankful everyday for my two boys. I&#039;m madly in love...

I do wish I was more patient though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post! Well articulated and everything I feel too. Although, I feel like I moaned a lot in the last 12 months about the loss of my identity as a woman, I am making a determined effort in the next 12 months to enjoy this time instead of waging a war against it. I have decided my two kids are enough (no third baby) and I have so much time in the future to focus on career etc. I will enjoy my wee boys now before I blink and they are too old to want me around anymore! ;-)
Happy Mothers Day]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d have to say it&#039;s all been for the better -- and I never thought I could LOVE THIS MUCH. I loved her as soon as I saw her and the feeling swells in my chest everyday. I just stare at her still (she&#039;s 3 1/2 months old) for hours each day and think about how beautiful she is &amp; how happy I am to have her!
I worked really hard at breastfeeding and have learned to do it well and this is a change which means a lot to me.
Thank you for this post -- very special, for a very special day -- my first mother&#039;s day!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good article.  Yes there are the hard aspects of motherhood.  As a mother of 5 and grandma to 4, I can tell you to never look back.  It&#039;s the best thing in the world.  Watching your babies grow and turn into wonderful people that you love to be around!  It&#039;s all worth it.]]></description>
