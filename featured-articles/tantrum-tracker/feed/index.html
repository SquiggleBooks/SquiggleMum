		<description><![CDATA[Hi! I have two kids,but being tired and out of routine is the greatest culprit. Even a half hour delay on their routine counts. So, I make sure to remember everything.
Nice observation and nice post! Have a great day! :)]]></description>

Yes, it is a wise mother indeed who indentifies the tantrum cause and doesn&#039;t look to blame it on anything else! Maybe you could get him to wave at the Wiggles at the end of each aisle?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My 2 year old always has a tantrum for the same reason.  Everytime we get to one end of the aisles at Coles he would start screaming.  It didn&#039;t take me long to work out why.  From there he can see the Wiggles Car in the main part of the shopping centre and he is determined that we should stop shopping so he can have a ride.  Since it&#039;s the only time he has a tantrum I&#039;m not going to put it down to more sinister items such as food additibes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hiya!
I loved this idea!!!!  I think it&#039;s great to be able to identify what the &#039;tantrum&#039; relates to!

Recently (due to a family-related illness) we had cause to have our son assessed for a sleep disorder/problem tonsils/adenoids etc.
Long story but his breathing seems affected and in having another family member assessed the question was asked if &#039;others&#039; are affected and if the result is &#039;bad behaviour&#039;!  The nurse apologised for her candid question!  But I think she hit the nail on the head - our 6 yr old was not sleeping properly!

So for now we have antihistamine to settle the tonsils down (as they swell at night during sleep) and we have referrals to see a specialist to have him assessed to see where we go from here.  It&#039;s all making sense now and fitting together and we&#039;ve had much better behaviour since we addressed the sleep/tonsil issue!

Cheers
Michelle]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is smart and inspiring. Sometimes we just need to take up the challenge to discover the route out of our problems. The Tantrum Tracker is a wonderful idea for most moms to have a checklist on their kids. It&#039;s important to be observant, and find out the root cause of the Tantrum issue.

Another great example of clever mom nowadays. ^^

		<description><![CDATA[The fantastic thing about using something like a tracker, is that you start seeing tantrums from a new perspective.  Quite often we ask a lot of our little ones and they can only cope with so much.  Tantrums are really a way of children expressing themselves until they can better control and regulate their emotions.  Using a tracker would certainly help you interpret what they say.

Oh and I would definitely put the key on the tracker.

Have you thought about putting it on Google Docs?  I have uploaded my Family budget their accessible for the world and it gets a few hits coming from the google search engine.]]></description>
