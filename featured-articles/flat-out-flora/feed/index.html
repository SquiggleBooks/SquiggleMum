		<description><![CDATA[Beautiful cards! I love kid friendly crafty things that also make wonderful gifts.
We are not fans of waiting either. Actually, the last time we tried pressing leaves we forgot all about them until I went to look something up in the phone book a few months later!]]></description>

That&#039;s a great idea.  Mum puts leaves etc into the press ahead of time.  Kids get to &quot;open&quot; the press and make cards/bookmarks/collages/whatever with the leaves.  Then when finished, all go outside and collect things to refill the press for next time!]]></description>
