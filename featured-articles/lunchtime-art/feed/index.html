		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m with Christie... I thought using cutters was interesting.  These sandwiches are a work of art.  I&#039;m all for creating interesting lunches but I hope these don&#039;t take as long as a 3yr old&#039;s birthday cake!!!  Please show us pics of your sandwich creations this week Cath.  FUN!]]></description>
