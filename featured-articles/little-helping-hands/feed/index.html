		<description><![CDATA[Wanting to build option B into our lives. We currently are encouraging our daughter to put away her laundry (if she&#039;s on a roll she will also help with other family members), to help clean up toys before bed, she takes her plate to the sink after meals, and has recently asked to help wash dishes (only the non-breakable, non-sharp stuff). We&#039;re already working on teaching the babies to clean up toys...I don&#039;t want them to feel like they have too many chores, but it is encouraging to me that I won&#039;t forever be cleaning up after them all the time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good advice. I remember being in charge of rinsing dishes when I was really little. These days I guess we have newfangled machines to take care of that for us, but it was an important job. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love it when my girls (almost 4 &amp; 18mths) like to help me clean the house! I give them cleaning cloths &amp; they are great at rubbing in the polish! Little Miss almost 4 has just started to want to use the vaccum cleaner so that takes a bit longer, while Miss 18mths has discovered the toilet brush!!?!?!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[At 17 months Immy loves helping (let&#039;s hope it lasts).  She;
- helps put away the washing by putting the tea towels and the facewashers we use at meal times in the kitchen drawer
- helps put away the dishes by putting her plastic bowls and containers and lids in the cupboard, even stacking the bowls
- helps put away the shopping, putting everything on the pantry shelf that she can reach, I let her and sort it out later as I would rather encourage her to help than tell her she is not putting things in the right place
- oh, and she LOVES the vacuum, the dustpan and brush and the broom!

		<description><![CDATA[I am a mixture of the two! The kids help me during the day - and they even have kid size tools to help - including a mini vacuum cleaner and broom. But I still get to the end of the day, when the kids are tucked in bed, and I survey the house in dismay...it&#039;s just not the way I like it. I can&#039;t help myself and I clean up some more. I find that I can go to bed feeling more relaxed when it&#039;s cleaned the way I like it... Having said that, my house is still no where near immaculate!! :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m definitely an Option B Mum too, otherwise nothing would get done. I&#039;ve also had to lower my standards when it comes to having a spotless (or not so much) house. The kids both take turns setting the table and cleaning up after dinner. They love to clean windows, walls and floors, the bathroom etc. My son, weirdly, loves cleaning the toilet! They don&#039;t like vaccuuming, but they will sweep with a dustpan and brush. Missy also likes to help fold towels, and hand-washing any dishes that need to be done. I think it teaches them responsibility and that a family has to work together to get things done - also that it&#039;s not just Mum&#039;s &#039;work&#039;.]]></description>
