		<description><![CDATA[Mum of the year!! I think this is a really great idea... to see what other Mums do with their children, organise their day etc. As a first time Mum my days seem to have no organisation and I am happy when I make it till 5.30pm when my husband walks in the door. lol. My baby is a little terror. What do other Mums do during the day when they just have/had a baby?]]></description>
