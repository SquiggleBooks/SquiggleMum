		<description><![CDATA[I had 3 imaginary friends when I was a child. I can only remember having 2 - Mario and Daniel. Mum said I would refuse to eat at the table unless she set room for my &#039;friends&#039;. The weird part I have been told is Daniel &#039;went back home&#039; the day my cousin Daniel was born...?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Iam 58 and I had lots of imaginary friend (although must admit no animals). As far as I am aware I grew up resonably normal. I did have and still do have a great imagination. I like to feel I am artistic and that is where imagination is a great help. I have 3 daughters, but only one had an imaginary friend, she is now married with a child of her own who is such a character I think she will probably have lots of &quot;friends&quot;. Enjoy it while it lasts. they grow up so fast. As long as the imaginary life doesn&#039;t take over from the real worls you have nothing to worry about and at 3 you have a long way to go before that becomes an issue.

		<description><![CDATA[That is beautiful!

My sister and I shared an imaginary friend. His name was Johnamajon. God, what a legend that thing was (still is!) in our family. My sis also had another &quot;friend&quot; Nutra. So funny to think back on.

Come to think of it, I still have imaginary friends that I talk to during the day - George Clooney for one. But maybe that&#039;s an entirely different topic ...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Totally normal and all good...

My girls spend hours together making up the most amazing stories... mostly it is of unicorns and fairies visiting them in the night and leaving presents... and if I can&#039;t see the presents it&#039;s just because I don&#039;t believe in them enough...]]></description>
