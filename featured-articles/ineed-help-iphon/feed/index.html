		<description><![CDATA[LOVE my iphone :)

I like PandoraBox - you can check what apps are free that day. I have only bought a couple of apps - everything I use is free!

Love &quot;ToDo&quot; - you can write with your finger on it instead of having to type in.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Just thought I would add a couple of my favourite apps.

I agree that ShopShop is great

Shazam is fun - hold your iphone up to music and it will tell you the name and singer (free)
HeyWay - if your partner or friends also have this they can send you location updates or you can request their&#039;s - eg my husband &quot;HeyWay&#039;s&quot; me when he is at daycare so I know he has picked Emma up and I go straight home - he could message but HeyWay is fun!. (Free)

My daughter likes DoodleBuddy - a drawing application (Free)
PaperToss - Emma is better at it then I am!

Thanks for your list Tracy - I&#039;m going to get a few of them! :)

Have fun with the iphone Cath! :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, congratulations, Cath! What a fantastic surprise for you. Thanks for this convicting post. I&#039;m not very technological savvy and often need to ask my oldest son to help me with computer/mobile phone problems. And I&#039;m well aware that one day he won&#039;t be around so often. But you&#039;re totally right, it broadens our horizons and impact when we know what&#039;s going on.
Blessings,
Paula]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are a few really good apps (mostly free) that I use all the time on my iphone.

a.  Boxcar - it beeps at me everytime there&#039;s a new tweet from one of those I follow. - cost about $3

b.  Evernote, which is a bit like google notebook.  You can capture thoughts/tweets/pics/emails etc all in a notebook type program for later.  - free

c.  Dropbox - brilliant app on both your pc and iphone which means you drop files in the box, and it syncs the file with your other devices. - free

d.  Twitterific.  I used to use echofon, but changed to twitterific.  Just personal taste. - free

e.  Fring - can sign into MSN, google chat, skype, yahoo etc all from one app - free

f.  Optus my account - if you&#039;re on a data plan, you can make sure you don&#039;t overspend. - free

g.  Facebook.  nuff said.

h.  Youversion.com Bible - brilliant. - free

i.  ShopShop shopping list - I&#039;ve stopped using scraps of paper for my shopping list and store it all on the iphone.

j.  Yellow pages - free

k.  Around me -  because I travel quite a bit, it finds my GPS location and tells me where the supermarket/restaurants etc are - free.

l.  Mybrisbane.  not a bad app for traffic, fuel prices, transport timetables etc - free.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Transfer the contacts on your old phone (if they were stored on the phone) to the old SIM then put the the old SIM into the iPhone. Hit &quot;Settings&quot;, then &quot;Mail, Contacts, Calendars&quot;.  Scroll down and hit &quot;Importing SIM Contacts.&quot;

I say the old SIM because I think (but not 100%) that you can&#039;t do that to the iPhone SIM.

I would find it difficult to cope without my iPhone.  I find it so handy with its calendar and ability to find an address straight from Contacts.  I&#039;ve bought Sygic, GPS software and now need to work out how to make it recognise the addresses in my Contacts.  Am having far too much fun with it...but it&#039;s solely for organisation purposes...really...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lol, that last paragraph made me chuckle. :)
A friend of mine got a new iphone last week and had to take it back as she couldnt work anything out on it!!
I agree with a previous poster, it is hard sometimes to work out a balance of everything. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just found this - http://www.occupybaby.com/

Maybe your 12mth old isn&#039;t too young after all - I haven&#039;t tried it so don&#039;t know what its like - could be well worth the 99 cent investment (I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s US too so a little more than that)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I find it hard to strike a balance between what is necessary, practical and affordable.  The new technologies are very much marketed towards young people with a highly disposable income, sadly we are on 1 or sometime no income and keeping up can be hard.    In saying that I think it is really cool that you won one!  :D]]></description>
