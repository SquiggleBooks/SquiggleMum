		<description><![CDATA[My mornings start at 4.30am, my husbands alarm goes off, he snoozes I&#039;m just awake.

I laze back stretching thinking about my day, with the rooster crowing in the background.

I&#039;ll get up and put the kettle on for hubby, crawl back in an we savour our quiet time together - it&#039;s often the only time we have alone - go over each others days - then I do a bit of stretching while hubby gets ready for work.

As the Kookuburras start their chortling (personally I think they know what I&#039;m in for!) approx 5.30am the onslaught starts -
FOUR KIDS AND A HUNGRY JACK RUSSEL!

It&#039;s up to find uniforms, retrieve lunch packs, sign notes, check emails (I find it funny how many small businesses do work at 3am! It can be a great time to be on forums)

Put washing on, feed the chooks fetch the eggs, clean up rooms, hang washing up, have breakfast, bake cookies - easiest recipe on in the world now the kids do it! washing up, prepare dinner, do left over homework, give everyone the once over and out the door.

Sometimes a hair brush and toothbrush is involved!

Whoa, I might go and have a cup of tea.]]></description>

YES! I miss it too.  Sometimes I wonder if we shouldn&#039;t get dolled up just for ourselves. I wonder if I&#039;d enjoy the housework more in heels...?]]></description>
