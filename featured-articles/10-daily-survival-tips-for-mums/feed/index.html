		<description><![CDATA[Great tips for moms! I&#039;m grandma to 9 now, but still remember those days, probably because I&#039;m enjoying helping up close with 4 and long distance with 5 adorables :)

My favorite suggestions were always 3, 4,5, and 9. Naptime was never an option til they were in school. Since we homeschooled for several years, they just kept having their quiet rest time and so did I :)

I still have fun playing with my grandkids whenever we are together. One of my daily goals whenever we are together is to combine fun times with learning times. In addition to dinosaur tag and playing cards, I have fun adding in Bible memory learning for Awanas, counting by 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s while playing hide-n-seek, and reading books that teach about God and His love for them. Just having that as a set goal keeps me remembering to do it, even when things get a tad crazy :)

Be seeing you again at the 30 day challenge :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wonderful list!  I&#039;m so glad you stopped by my blog, because I will enjoy browsing yours.  I do about half of these things.  I agree on the shower being tough to get.  To add to the list: organize play dates, field trips, etc. with other moms.  It makes me feel so much more refreshed and patient after having been with other moms, and my little guy sleeps SO well afterwards!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, also found you via 31 day challenge. As a new mom I really like your tips, especially the hot shower(!)

		<description><![CDATA[So true! This is such a useful list - and I find that the morning shower is always the hardest thing to achieve.

Thanks for sharing,
