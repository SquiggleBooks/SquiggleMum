		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re in SE Qld too and our home doesn&#039;t warm up a lot, so Mr 1 loves to spend some time enjoying the winter sun each day, pottering around the yard exploring while I peg out washing.

I also like to snuggle on the lounge in the evenings under a feather quilt - so cosy, with a home-baked hot pudding and a cup of hot Milo.  Bliss!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Even here in NSW (the Central Coast) we&#039;ve had lots of lovely days where I&#039;ve taken my children to the beach.

It&#039;s perfect weather for building sandcastles and running wild on the sand - without worrying about the kids getting too hot/sunburnt.

Sounds like you enjoyed your &#039;few days&#039; of winter!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1  We also spend lots of time out in the sunshine enjoying parks.  Our house is old and very cold inside so we go anywhere where the sun is.

2  We wear our pyjamas and slippers a little longer than we should.

3  We love long warm bubble baths where we sing and play games.

4  We bake delicious warm dessert treats. (Some just for mummy + daddy too! Shhh don&#039;t tell the kids!!)

5  We also enjoy pumpkin soup.  It&#039;s very simple to make and tastes so good. It&#039;s almost wrong that something that simple to make should taste so great.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hate the cold, and hate being without my gloves when it is cold and my thermal socks.  My dh jokes that I only leave my gloves at home in July and August!

I much prefer warmth, but then it never really gets too hot here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;re having some glorious winter weather right now, down here in Newcastle. Since summer is usually spent in the pool from dawn til dusk, winter afternoons are for kicking the ball around and riding bikes. We also do a lot of baking while it&#039;s not too hot in the kitchen.]]></description>
