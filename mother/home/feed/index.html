		<description><![CDATA[My home&#039;s a little quieter today...There&#039;s one loud, contagious, joyful giggle missing.  My &#039;Baby&#039; left for Sydney yesterday and I miss her dreadfully...in fact, there has been flooding in Ferny Hills overnight!!  So for me &#039;home&#039;  is a place where memories spring out from every nook and cranny to prick my tender heart...but it&#039;s also a safe haven where my daughter knows she will always be welcomed back and showered with unconditional love, laughter and licks (from her puppy, Mr Bigglesworth)!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a good time in your life to experience what a lot of people live with every day. With no hope of owning their own home, they make every house they live in a home because their loved ones are there.  I know you felt secure in your house but you can feel just as secure in a rental house.  It&#039;s just a different feeling.  As long as love is there, it doesn&#039;t matter where you are living.   Looking forward to seeing you soon.  Love you all &lt;3]]></description>
