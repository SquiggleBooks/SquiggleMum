		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath, I totally understand about the sign around your neck (or boosies!) `The Bulk of the Feed Came from Me....Really!!&#039; I had to comp. with the twins and it was one of the hardest things to do! I hits right on the `guilty mother&#039; nerve! You do whatever is the best for a healthy happy baby. If you would feel better with organic formula....there is a brand called Bellamy&#039;s that&#039;s made in Tasmania. It is at some Coles and Woolies.

On Nicole&#039;s comment, ;there is a theory that teeth indicate readiness for food. They show that the digestive enzymes in the baby&#039;s gut have changed to accept solids. The age thing is fairly arbitary, go by the teeth! Sounds like you are doing exactly the right thing. Some babies are just ready earlier than others. :-)

Cheers  :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I could never think anything other that &#039;What a wonderful Mummy&#039;.  You have put your career on hold, run MOPS, Provide all that your children could ever need and want.  It would be neglegent not to offer him a bottle.  You are doing a fantastic job, #1 is a beautiful lillte girl and I have no doubt that #2 will be a wonderful little boy.  They would not sell formula if it was not safe.   I have put my bub onto food already.  He feeds non stop - I dont have a milk supply problem, I just have a bottomless pit of a child.  That was a hard decision to make too as people look at you as to say - &quot;That baby is to young for food.&quot;  Yet he has teeth and is the size of a 1 year old.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh Cath, I feel your angst.  I remember what it felt like to have to make that choice.  After a while, though, I got to thinking that maybe I was meant to go through that experience to help me gain a deeper understanding of what other mums have been through, and the inner turmoil they probably went through to come to whatever decision was best for themselves and their bubs.  Don&#039;t worry about what other mums might be thinking; do what&#039;s best for your little man, because ultimately that&#039;s best for you too!]]></description>
