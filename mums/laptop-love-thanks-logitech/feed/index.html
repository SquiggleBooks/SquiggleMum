		<description><![CDATA[I like the speaker lapdesk you are using in the photo on the Logitech website. I jump from place to place too. Recently I purchased an iPad which means my portable office now consists of a MacBook, iPhone and iPad which move with me. It&#039;s not quite as mad as it sounds. In particular my iPhone gets a lot of use by different children outside when I visit schools. I&#039;ve found children to be really respectful of my equipment.

		<description><![CDATA[Happy that you were selected too to represent the Logitech&#039;s campaign :) I would have thought that they only selected tech bloggers for the campaign!

and yeah, I love the Notebook kit too so much although it&#039;s more like my sister who uses it a lot on the laptop while I&#039;m on the desktop
