		<description><![CDATA[I was a little shocked at first, but then i loved it. Is seems they continued the theme today with digital cameras and hand held GPS. I think it&#039;s great they are teaching our kids about the world they live in.
LOVE your cardboard laptop too. I&#039;m going to make one if that&#039;s ok. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I guess I do not understand the controversy this would cause.  We are a very &quot;connected&quot; family and I feel that technology fits right in next to the crayons and storybooks.

I mean, if the people who were upset were watching Play School, chances are it was on a TV right?
