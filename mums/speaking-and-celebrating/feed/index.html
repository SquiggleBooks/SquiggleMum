		<description><![CDATA[I too wish I could have attended your workshop.  I&#039;d love the know the answers to the questions your other readers have asked.  Also, tips for increasing the numbers of your readers.  And do you feel that to have a successful blog you have to have a theme (like parenting)?  And how do you go about arranging giveways on your blog?  Thanks for opening the floor up to us.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, I think it&#039;s great that you&#039;re involved in this, because in any business, it&#039;s often easy to get too caught up in what you do.  It&#039;s always good to see other people in a similar field, whether they are doing the same thing as you, or something completely different.  Now for my questions!

How do you draw the line at what to write about?  I&#039;m sure you often have ideas that don&#039;t necessarily fall under the broad &quot;mummy stuff&quot; banner.  Do you save them up for something else, or try and find a way to tie them in?  I guess this would also apply on a more personal level.  Writing a blog like this is fairly personal.  How much of yourself do you give away, and how do you decide where to draw the line, for both yourself and your family?

Thanks for your ongoing ideas and inspiration!  Us non-mums need all the help we can get!]]></description>

I&#039;ll come back when I think of a question. I have so many, and now given the chance, I can&#039;t think of one! :)

How do you organise time to write your posts?  Do you write a bunch at once so you have some up your sleeve?
