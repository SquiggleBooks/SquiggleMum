		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,

An interesting &amp; enlightening read.  I&#039;m very new to the world of blogging, WAHM &amp; C2M for that matter.  My world does still comprise the majority of skin on friends &amp; I&#039;m learning to interact now on the flip side.

Thanks for highlighting the importance of the balancing act.  I&#039;ll tune in on your posts.

Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello gorgeous!
Loved your thoughts on this....
Since hitting the road permanently man do I miss my skin on friends...really craving contact from them like never before. And our family has become closer and more tightnit as a result. But you need friends, we are created for community!
You are such a sweetie! Doing an amazing job...I think you&#039;re wonderful!
Love and hugs

		<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful post, and gentle encouragement to spend quality time with our friends &quot;off-line&quot;. I love facebook and blogs, but am finding sometimes it fills that gap temporarily that a hug and a cuppa with a good friend should fill. Bless you! You look divine in that dress - where did you get it from?? (Want one!!) :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a bit lacking in the skin on variety of friends too.  And as Christie mentioned sometimes it&#039;s so hard to catch the ones who live closest.  Working hard on maintaining better friendships this year :)

		<description><![CDATA[It is so great that we have the internet as a resource for those who are isolated. I think you are right though, those &quot;skin on&quot; friendships are so important. I feel so very blessed to have great real life friendships, and I am just starting to develop the on-line ones (and some cross over). Interesting that some of my real-life and on-line friends say I am much more &quot;opinionated&quot; on-line!
