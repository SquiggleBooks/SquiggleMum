		<description><![CDATA[So glad to have come across your blog (love the design BTW). Our backyard is far from my dream yard at the moment but as I say &quot;it has good bones.&quot; Love the ideas you have for a perfect yard- some of that I hadn&#039;t considered yet (like the creek bed). Thanks for the ideas- maybe one day soon I&#039;ll actually get to act on them!!

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so pleased I stumbled across your blog via Twitter. I&#039;m in the process of revamping my backyard because it needs it. I spend my time giving advice to schools about how to do this and then neglect my own patch...!

I always ask my son for his thoughts. This time, we&#039;re going for lots of edible foods, especially berries and fruit trees. We&#039;re creating a pond, log piles and continuing to plant native species to increase the biodiversity. He&#039;s 13yrs old now. The other plan is to create an outdoor cooking spot with a table tennis &quot;cover&quot;

If my son was younger, we&#039;d definitely have: a sandpit - the larger the better, a mud/digging area, big water experiences via an outdoor tap, places to hide and an outdoor dressing up and den building box. And lots of bits and pieces left outside to continue play the next day!

		<description><![CDATA[We have a beautiful backyard...I can say this because my husband has done most of the work to make it and keep it that way. We have a big oak tree in the middle that a squirrel planted perhaps 15 years ago. It currently holds two swings (a baby swing and a disc swing) which both get a lot of use. It also has a couple of ropes that my daughter likes to climb. We are hoping to build a treehouse soon so we can add a slide, some monkeybars, and a kid hideout. My kids desperately need something to climb on...They find their own spaces to dig and play with water...The only other thing I wish we had is space to grow veggies. We have a pear tree, and a lemon tree. Sometimes we are lucky with tomatoes. I&#039;d love to grow peas, zucchini, pumpkin, carrots, and potatoes. Hubby says we don&#039;t have enough sunny space for all of this.
