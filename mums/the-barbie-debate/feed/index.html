		<description><![CDATA[Hi, I&#039;m a 13 year old girl and my class is doing a debate on whether Barbie should look more &#039;normal&#039; or not. I&#039;m opposing the motion because Barbie never influenced me when I was growing up.
I wanted to thank you for helping me put my anger into words-Barbie was a good friend and very fun. I&#039;m most deffinetely NOT a Barbie girl (tanned, dark curly hair etc.) but I love myself the way I am. Maybe it had something to do with my amazing African mother who had a strict upbringing and tends to have &#039;girl&#039; talks during an episode of Glee. It&#039;s annoying but they&#039;ve kept me grounded and when I&#039;m older, I want to be like my Mum, not like Barbie.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[loved reading this and all of the comments.

i also loved playing with barbies growing up. had a massive barbie house, a fancy barbie car, lots of barbie dolls, and heaps and heaps of clothes. i LOVED dressing them up in different clothes and doing their hair over and over. surprised any of them were left with any hair as i brushed it SO much. playing with my barbie dolls is one of my only childhood memories--and a happy one at that. never did my mum talk to me about barbie&#039;s body, or my own for that matter. and i think the only thing i may have taken from my barbie phase is that, for a long time, i thought i wanted to grow up to me a hairdresser.
i have immense body issues but i can DEFINITELY say that none of them came from playing with barbies. i am sure of that. i know mine came from a heap of things i.e. growing up in california from ages 9-19 where body image is a gigantic issue; from having a baby when i was only 15 which changed my then slim body drasically (extra tummy skin never returned to normal); not having confidence instilled in me from my mum or real father, etc, etc.
i have a two year old daughter now and raising her to be strong and self-assured in every way is at the forefront of my mind...and that includes playing with barbie dolls. i am EXCITED at the thought of sitting down with her to dress them up and make their hair look nice....but i am MORE excited to know my little girl will get her self-esteem and value from myself and my husband rather than a doll or other things that can influence us.
thanks for giving us the chance to share ourselves, our thoughts, and to reminise a bit on our days of play. : )
(FYI: i was just rereading this outloud to check it, and my daughter just said &quot;i want a barbie doll&quot; outloud (as she heard me saying it). she does have one that we picked up at an op shop so she knows the name already, but i thought that was pretty funny)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be giving my daughter Barbie dolls to play with. I grew up with Barbie dolls but I think she&#039;s just a bit too thin &amp; perfect looking! LOL. I&#039;ll happily give my daughter cabbage patch dolls to play with as they don&#039;t fit the stereotype of a stick thin girl. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved playing with Barbie dolls when I was a girl and I enjoy watching my youngest daughter enjoy playing with them too!  She loves changing their clothes and creates wonderful games.  Even now, I enjoy strolling down the Barbie isle and looking at all the beautiful clothes. To me, it&#039;s a lot of fun.

Personally, I think a &#039;bad&#039; body image is a collection of many things.  While it&#039;s important to shelter my children, it’s impossible to eliminate all forms of negative body image.  Instead, I try and instil the truth of ‘real’ beauty in their lives.

As I remember, I didn&#039;t even think of a Barbie&#039;s body when I was playing with them.  I do wonder sometimes, if we &#039;plant&#039; seeds unknowingly because we are trying so hard not to??? Hmmm, interesting thought.

In saying that, I don&#039;t buy &#039;Bratz&#039; dolls for the obvious &#039;attitude&#039; so I guess it&#039;s a personal thing.

Interesting post.  Enjoyed reading everyone’s comments.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,
I love reading your blog and always find helpful hints for my parenting skills.  This certainly is an interesting topic.  I played with lots of Barbies as a child - and I mean lots!  In fact it could be fair to say that I was a barbie freak.  I had heaps of them.  The thing is, I don&#039;t ever remember looking at Barbie and thinking wow, I want to look like her or be like her when I grow up.  Barbie was just a toy.  I spent many wonderful hours playing with her and doing her hair etc.  Now I too have a daughter - 2 of them in fact.  One is 3 and the other just 1.  My 3 year old loves Barbie as well.  Loves playing with her and brushing her hair just as I did.  She loves for me to play &quot;Barbies&quot; with her and its in this time that I often hear previous conversations that we have had come out.  I use this time to role play with her and try to teach her.

In regards to body image, well as a mum I think that&#039;s my job to try and show her to love and accept herself just as she is by doing that with myself.  I certainly don&#039;t have a perfect body and would love to swap with someone else some days but I have come to accept that I can&#039;t be bothered to diet heaps and can&#039;t afford plastic surgery.  Anyway, I have made a rule that I will never talk negatively about my own body in front of my girls and have even instructed other female relatives to do the same.  If you can&#039;t say anything nice, then well just don&#039;t say it.  I think its far more dangerous in regards to body image when us mums and aunts and grandma&#039;s speak about ourselves badly in front of our children.  Anyway, just my thoughts....]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Cath,

Wow, everyone loves to talk about Barbie! I must say that as a child I did not like Barbie not sure why I think its because I always though she was for little kids and I always wanted to be grown up and before I had my daughter I always though I would not allow her to have Babies.

But now I am a big fan of the dolls and the movies, Barbie is a strong, independent fictional character, she doesn&#039;t swear or dumb herself down, she isn’t bitchy or rude, she is never the damsel and always the hero,she cares for others and all to a great musical soundtrack! ( I must admit I am a sucker for a musical!)

I don&#039;t believe in the fashion dolls for young girls, mostly because I find the clothing very inappropriate. But we do have a small collection of fairytale Barbie dolls and movies and I find my daughter draws more from Barbie’s characters of adventure, bravery, singing for all occasions and caring for others then from being blonde, and skinny.

		<description><![CDATA[LOL laughing at the last 2 comments!
I didn&#039;t grow up with Barbie and I felt left out.
Then I decided that Barbie was bad and I didn&#039;t want my girls having any.
Then they were given Barbie for gifts and I rethought my motives.
Now I try to teach them that Barbie is fictional - the same way we talk about movies and shows being made up.
Now my girls 8,6 and 2 only play Barbie when they have friends over.
I&#039;m hoping it&#039;s not really an issue....
