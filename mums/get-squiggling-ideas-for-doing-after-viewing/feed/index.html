		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been amazed lately with what my son (3) can draw.  He watches Play School and picks up a lot of what they do and say.

Brian was given some sidewalk chalk for his birthday but we don&#039;t have a concrete area for him to draw, but there is a public pathway nearby.  What do you think - would that amount to graffiti?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Such a colourful show, my kids can&#039;t take their eyes off Squiglet! I love that Get Squiggling encourages kids to have a go at their own creations, while giving them some simple ideas for drawings as well. Both my kids love drawing (ages 6 and 2). To encourage drawing at home, just keep the drawing stuff handy and accessible to the kids, is my best advice. Not a day goes by that both my kids don&#039;t draw me something new, as they have free access to the pencils and paper. One of those great activities a parent doesn&#039;t have to guide too much!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It looks like a very colorful show and very appealing to little ones. I am always happier about my preschooler having some TV time during the day, if we do some activities afterward relating to what he&#039;s just watched]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi ..i love this, my 5 yr old loves drawing and has been watching this programme. I do all the ideas you suggested(must be a teacher thing)and have to say they are spot on, to develop creativy..there is no better way to entertain kids other than a pencil and paper..
i made a drawing book for my little girl and at first she just squiggled on every page, but now she draws actual drawings, so i have created an alphabet book for her to fill in herself..links drawing, writing and reading..she loves finding things to draw under the correct sound, and then writes the name of it.]]></description>
