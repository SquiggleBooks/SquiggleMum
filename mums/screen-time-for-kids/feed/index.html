		<description><![CDATA[My first blog was called &quot;Turn Off the Televsion&quot; and I really noticed a huge change in children when I turnedd off the t.v. and gave them a craft corner instead - it was like their imaginations were set free.
Stay tuned to my blog as I start to explore whether or not so called &quot;educating&quot; technology is good or bad...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this, and love that you mentioned how it can fit into a routine. My husband grew up with the TV on 24/7 and I grew up rarely watching it. We&#039;ve gotten to a place now that makes up both happy.
Sometimes I let the kids watch a 30-minute show when they wake up in the morning, while I get my coffee and check email. Then it&#039;s off all day. They have movie time from 6-7pm, after baths, then stories next, then prayers and bedtime. It&#039;s never on more than 1 1/2 hrs. I feel okay with that, and it gives me time to catch up with my husband. We don&#039;t have cable anyway, and we choose their Netflix movies.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is so true &#039;One of the biggest problems with television is what it doesn’t do&#039;. I worry more about what LIttle Eco is missing out while she watches TV, than the effects of actually watching.

Thanks for the mention :-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a hard one. Now that i have had No2, i sometimes use the tv as a babysitter. Certainly not all day or even for hours. But for the evening feed or if i haven&#039;t been able to fit in a shower, i&#039;ll allow my daughter to watch a bit of Dora the explorer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[2 hours and a bit more in the weekends. However the max recommended time depends on the age. See here:

		<description><![CDATA[I have noticed the difference when I babysit for different friends.  Kids who watch a lot of tv don&#039;t seem to be as good at finding ways to entertain themselves or thinking of things they&#039;d like to do.  Kids who have less seem better able to think outside the square - &quot;maybe we could make a huge cubby house and eat dinner inside!!&quot;...  I wonder if it has any long term affect once they&#039;re adults?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[when my older children were little they were exposed to far, far less screen time than my younger ones.  I do see a difference and it does concern me.  In fact I have just announced to my children we are going to try to limit once again.  When too much screen time occurs I see a loss of creative play and more irritableness.  Thanks for your post, you&#039;ve helped me redouble my effort:)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve definitely noticed that 2 hours is THE limit for my 5yo munchkin (and has been since he was 3). It doesn&#039;t matter the quality of content, or how engaged he is. Under that, and he will readily engage in other activities afterwards. More than that and he turns into THAT CHILD! I have no idea about the science behind this, but I can assure you it is very real, as one who as yearned for &quot;just a bit more work time&quot; and regretted it for the rest of the day (screen time is often mornings when he is home during the day), or while trying to get him to bed in the evenings. Crazy, but true!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this article, as with all parenting decisions, it&#039;s an interesting one.  I actually find the opposite to you, watching television is so mainstream that I feel very uncomfortable (and often judged) admitting that my nearly 2 year old never watches TV.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Squigglemum,
I love that you are my Mummy conscience!
But I love even more that you offer solutions and guidelines - another good link to the Screen speed bumps!
A solution to my guilty feelings.
Enjoy following you.
Thanks]]></description>
