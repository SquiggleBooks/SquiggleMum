		<description><![CDATA[The difference between bribery and reward is apparently when you give the treat; before = bribery, after = reward.  So you really just rewarded her!  Besides, I also think it is important to factor in her motivation to behave; e.g. is this an activity I can reasonably expect my child to find enjoyable?  Did she have any say in doing this?  Would I enjoy the same experience given the circumstances?

I really prefer the terms &quot;incentive&quot; or &quot;bonus&quot;; you get these for good work and it motivates you more!  How much you put in determines how much you get back; in your case, half a donut!

If what you did was sinking to a parenting &quot;low&quot;, then you&#039;ve really only joined the ranks of the rest of us!]]></description>
