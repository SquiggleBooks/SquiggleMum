		<description><![CDATA[I was never allowed a barbie as a child, until a friend gave me one for my birthday - mum couldn&#039;t really say no then.
As a teacher my concern is not the body image but the way girls play with them. Play tends to be all about dressing up and &#039;older&#039; themes rather than the imaginative play I see with other types of dolls. I see girls manipulate the barbie to play with other barbies, but with other dolls the girls play with each other with the dolls as props in the play (hope that makes sense). So as long as girls have other dolls not just barbies i think thats ok. At least barbie is a bit better than Bratz.

		<description><![CDATA[I did the gracious back down too when my SIL gave my girls their first Barbies... since then she has certainly multiplied in our house. I try to steer the girls towards the fantasy barbies (fairies and fairy tales) and those barbies that I feel portray more positive notions rather than just fashion (they got a vet barbie for their birthday from a friend who&#039;s Mum is a vet who they idolise).

We also talk about how Barbie isn&#039;t real, about how nobody really looks like that... we have similar conversations about TV and movies etc.

But I&#039;ve learnt to let them enjoy Barbie in their own way and I attempt to leave my own agenda at the bedroom door... mostly :)

Doctor Barbie did also gfeel the need to clarifiy whether any vampires lived with her patient the other day, and I have no idea where that came from! ROFL]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So when are they bringing out Debate Barbie!?!  She always seems to start one.  I think awareness is the start - you certainly won&#039;t be going on about how pretty Barbie is, you&#039;ll be pointing out her other meaningful characteristics.  There&#039;s plenty of negative things that we have to manage.  But I too cringe at the thought of my niece bringing a barbie over to play!  I guess you&#039;ll go through the same again when my nephew wants a toy gun...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I rememeber the post well, andthink it may have been the first one I commented on.

Often on my blog Barbie makes an appearance as she is very popular here. On the bookshelf there is a whole shelf dedicated to her, filled with dvds and books. I even found a Golden Book older than me which is on there.

What Barbie has taught me this last year is:

* Although one Barbie is usually a Princess (we have 8! With more on the way) most of them have careers such as swimming teachers, hairdressers, office workers and a doctor.

* Barbie has to deal with real life situations. Barbie and Ken are divorced and Barbie is a single mum. Luckily, she has a great network of other Barbies to help her look after her two kids.

* Each Barbie looks different and has a different body shape (which can make it hard to put clothes on!).One of ours is a surfer girl and her body shape is very different wit wider hips, thicker legs and feet that can only wear her own thongs (flip flops).

* She inspires a lot of great narrative play which can last for hours, even without my input.

* Her website has lots of games that show her at work in many different fields and helps my girl develop observation and problem solving skills.

So my feelings towards her have softened. I still don&#039;t like playing Barbies myself (how times have changed from my youth), but she is encouraging my girl to develop in so many ways that I can&#039;t really resent having her around.

(Oh, and as an aside, when choosing gifts for the wishing tree to give away, her choice for a girl was Barbie because she knows how much she loves hers and thought a girl would like one too. For a boy, a Mater car (from the Cars movie. I love that she chose to give something that she would love herself :) )]]></description>
