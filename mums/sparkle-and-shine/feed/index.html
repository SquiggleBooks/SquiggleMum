		<description><![CDATA[You should check out the Indian shops in capital cities. My in-laws are from India and Sri Lanka and they have often surprised me with a pair of gorgeous shiny/sparkly shoes from their specialty shopping trips (a few times a year they head to the &#039;big smoke&#039; to buy up the spices they can&#039;t grow at home). There&#039;s just something about a pair of sparkly shoes, isn&#039;t there?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My daughter hated wearing shoes when she was little, so to coax her (particularly in the middle of winter when looking at her cold tootsies made ME shiver LOL) I bought her some shiny silver shoes. They were made of a shiny quilted fabric and had soft soles - they were probably meant to be slippers - but it worked! She loved them. The next summer she had her &quot;rainbow shoes&quot; - sandals with pearlized pink, lavender and blue straps. You&#039;re right, all the fun shoes are in kids&#039; sizes - wouldn&#039;t have minded a pair of them myself!]]></description>
