		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m now a Huge fan of the garnier anti circle too, I&#039;m using it almost daily now. I also wish they would do a complete foundation in it too! You look amazing in those jeans and I&#039;m loving that jacket a lot. I&#039;m trying to do more for me so I feel good and also so it teaches the kids to learn to value them too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Love your style session photos.  I must confess (never thought I would say this) but when I saw you at Indooroopilly (for Giggle and Hoot) I wasn&#039;t sure it was you.  The reason I wasn&#039;t sure is that most people usually look worse in person than the pic on their blog, but you looked gorgeous!  Not that I don&#039;t love that pic with your kids either.

A style session is on my wishlist.  Being a Mumma I tend to buy the cheapest clothes for myself rather than what looks good.  I still have stuff in my wardrobe that has been there for over 10 years.  Shame!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t really enjoy clothes shopping at the moment because I am carrying around too many extra kgs, but I always feel good when I walk out of the hair salon. I don&#039;t mind paying for a good hair cut, but I do my own colour at home though to save money, and find the result is just as good! Every now and then a facial or massage is a real pick me up too. P.S. You look great in those clothes:)]]></description>
