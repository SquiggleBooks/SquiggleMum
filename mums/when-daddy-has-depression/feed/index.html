		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m just reading this now and wanted to say thanks both of you for sharing. My husband has battled depression on and off and certainly the most difficult year of our marriage so far was the year when he was in a very dark place. The process of diagnosis, medication and healing was both incredibly scary and incredibly lonely. It&#039;s the voices of those who have been there before, and aren&#039;t afraid to speak up, that made the journey a little lighter. God Bless.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As somebody who also battles depression, I applaud your hubby for not only being real and transparent, but also for breaking down the barriers and the stigma associated with this very real and sometimes crippling illness.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your openness.  I will pray for your husband but also for you. As a counselor, I know that depression can hang a black cloud over an entire household seeking to envelope everyone that it can.

May God be your light giving you warmth, comfort, and wisdom as you both walk this challenging walk.

God Bless,

Kim

		<description><![CDATA[Well done on being brave and talking about this...
its not uncommon and its nothing to be ashamed of- I myself battled PND and know first hand how hard it is for the men, who are often unfortunately overlooked
I hope that God gives you and your family the strength, love and faith to get through the hard times. Cherish the good times when a pair of funky Havaianas are the only way to go! xoxo]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m totally with you on the point about being open and honest and real about depression. It&#039;s such a common challenge. I know anecdotally and also from research that many many parents face depression from the mildest form to much more serious episodes. Parenting itself brings so much joy and love into our lives but it also triggers (especially in the perfectionistic, success-seeking, control-freak ish parents - like me!)feelings of inadequacy and introspection. All the best to your husband Cath and to you - luckily kids are can also be a great antidote to the blues and I&#039;m sure those munchkins of yours will do just that.]]></description>
