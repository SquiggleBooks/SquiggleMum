		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Cath, I hadn&#039;t thought of stationary. I have given coffee vouchers (Gloria Jeans have them in $5 and $10 denominations) or ice cream vouchers (Cold Rock)but love the idea of seedlings too. As well as Teachers Day and Christmas coming up, my daughters teacher has a birthday this month too. This will help.xx]]></description>
