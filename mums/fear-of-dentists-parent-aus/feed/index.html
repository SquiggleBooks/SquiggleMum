		<description><![CDATA[Oooh... love the article!

Boo had to have quite a bit of dental work on his baby teeth ($$$$) and was absolutely amazing.  I could not believe how well he handled it.  I hope that it&#039;s because I&#039;m not too freaked out by dentists and have passed that on to him.

Toto has only had minimal cleaning work done, and he hates it.  Getting him there is, well, like pulling teeth (pardon the pum!).  I just don&#039;t get it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That is so interesting about the inherent fears.

My children were excited about their first trip to the dentist. I have never understood the fear of the dentist, it is not something I dread.  I don&#039;t even get needles when I have a filling!  On the other hand, my husband is terrified of the dentist.

I think trust has a lot to do with it.  I know my children trust me, and know I will listen about how they feel. Plus, I think they may take after me, and in this instance, that is a good thing :)]]></description>
