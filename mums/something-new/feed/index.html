		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,
Just when I was feeling so frustrated this afternoon as Jack was not co-operating with me and having his sleep, I sat down to read your blog.  The line  - about hoping that just once this year your face lights up....  - put it all back into such perspective and brought a lump to my throat.  You really do have a gift with your writing - thanks for sharing it.
Cheers

		<description><![CDATA[Ah Cath - I&#039;ll have to remember that fly-spray tip!  A worthy goal getting caught up in the wonder of something new - I did the other day reading something new in the Bible and was in that place of wonder.  Keep your hopes high and your heart too - you never know what will cross your path this year.  Hope it&#039;s a great one for you and your family!  Oh - re the fire alarm, large volumes of plaster dust from sanding the new walls will do the same thing - trust me we know!]]></description>
