		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Gwenda.  You were always a great encouragement to me as a teacher, and now you are encouraging me as a mum!  I saw a photo of the school captains for 2009 last week.  Way to go Josh!  (PS - I&#039;m so going to have hot choc dates with my boy too).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know I was one of those Mum&#039;s that gave you a card to say a huge thank-you for teaching my son Joshua in Year 1.  You were such an amazing teacher and have left such an impression on him.  He still tells me that Mrs O was his favourite teacher!!

The demands of motherhood are certainly exhausting and sometimes seem thankless and never-ending.
But I know the delight my boys display when I arrive at school for parent help; tell them I&#039;ve baked their favourite cookies for afternoon tea; cheer them on at swimming carnivals; have an open house for any of their friends to visit; treasure hunts on birthdays and christmas morning; having a &quot;Hot Chocolate Date&quot; with each son individually every week.  This all takes time and effort and hard work but I believe these are the memories that they will carry throughout their lives.  I have vivid memories of my childhood and my mum investing so much time into us girls and I want to continue this tradition with my boys.
There is no greater vocation than motherhood!
Love the blog - brings back memories for me!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I always enjoy reading your blog, but this one struck a particular chord with me.

Since Betsy was born I&#039;ve struggled with the lack of recognition for what is ultimately the hardest and most important thing I&#039;ve ever done.  Inevitably, I&#039;ve also struggled with the subsequent guilt at having had such feelings.

Perhaps it&#039;s because my husband seems to have three every year...apparently it is an absolute necessity to have one for the region, one for the station and one for the office.  I&#039;m not greedy....I only want one!

The crazy thing is that I love not working!  I have no desire to return to my &#039;pre-children&#039; full-time work life.  I value the time spent with my kids far more highly than any token pat on the back from my work.....so why do I want it so badly?

It was with a sigh of relief that I read this latest instalment.  I still wish I didn&#039;t crave the recognition, but it has given me comfort to realise that I&#039;m not the only one who does.]]></description>
