		<description><![CDATA[A lot of people never realize how important a little introspection is. Kudos to you on that &quot;wonder&quot; alone.

I, too, wonder if my current path is helping or hindering my desire to be a &#039;writer of note.&#039; I have recently made some exciting decisions.

Most of all, I love that you understand that your children own their stories and have the right to tell them themselves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too wonder about your third point.  I&#039;ve been blogging for over 5 years and it&#039;s purpose has changed multiple times.  It is surely right to do what works for you.

What I love most about your blog is that you are local Mum, you are honest, you give me the chance to reflect on what I&#039;m doing with my kids and you have given me many ideas for playing, learning and growing with my own kids.  = )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I will follow you, you have helped me with so many ideas I have implemented in my workplace. I love hearing about your children&#039;s stories but do understand they are their stories. I have always asked my children if I can facebook their stories and are always willing. They love hearing the feedback. Best of luck in what you decide is best xxx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re so brave to pause, wonder and change the direction of your life.

I think it&#039;s so important to reflect on where we are going, and life is meant to be a journey where sometimes things come to an end so you can begin again.

Good luck with your break and the decisions you&#039;ll be making soon.]]></description>
