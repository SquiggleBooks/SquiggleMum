		<description><![CDATA[I have a mini tub of playdoh. They can play with it or I make it into shapes and they guess what it is or I break the pieces up and we do counting. Endless fun. I also have some plastic beads and a shoe string for threading and I carry some reins - the kids sit and love clipping and unclipping all the clips on it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I kept my twins pretty entertained for most of 45 minutes the other day just by doling out cheerios four and five at a time. Only works when food is allowed and wanted, though.

I recently took some long walks with friends and when the twins started getting bored they were messing with each other in the stroller. I picked a couple of ivy leaves nearby the walking trail and gave one to each twin. They LOVED it and it kept their hands busy so they couldn&#039;t mess with each other.

		<description><![CDATA[I take pencils &amp; colouring book out with us or small toys.A handbag or backpack of
tricks is essential for my twinsanity.

That game looks amazing – please let us all know if you find a source!

I have a wooden toy of 6 coloured rectangular blocks connected by elastic it was $4.95 and it is the best travel toy ever no pieces to lose and it makes so many different things.Called a What&#039;z it fidget block.It can create a tower, a bed, a letter of the alphabet or just fidget with the blocks. Such Fun!

Adults love it too.It clicks &amp; clacks ...I really wanted a wooden &#039;Jacob&#039;s ladder&#039; click clack toy which is similar but flatter blocks.

I got it from special needs toys australia they have hundreds of toys under $10 perfect for ahandbag of tricks.Must stay away from it ;).

		<description><![CDATA[We&#039;ve had some success using an old baby wipes container and some paddle pop sticks - my 18 month old would spend ages posting the sticks through the hole in the top of the container. And stickers will keep him going for a while there too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes the bag of tricks is essential Catherine.  Lately we&#039;ve had to take ours to all sorts of places.  I usually put stickers and paper in there for sticker collage, some little books (like the little Charlie n Lola books), some sort of quiet game or the Maisy/Playschool/Bananas magnetic boards and colouring in.  By far the best thing that goes into the bag is the pencil wallet that Aunty Mel (my lovely sister-in-law) made for the girls for Christmas this year.  It&#039;s a fabric roll which has felt sewn onto it in a way that allows the pencils to be neatly stored.  It fits easily into the bag or the girls backpacks.  I thought this was a great homemade present.  We have used them over and over and over again.
