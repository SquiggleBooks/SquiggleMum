		<description><![CDATA[I stopped checking my stats in March last year. I think it makes me a better writer if I focus on who I am writing for — my family — and not simply just try to drum up a list of followers. Frankly, I&#039;m considering turning off my comments altogether, but ... I do like to meet other wonderful people, and sometimes they stop by my blog and say hi!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Nice to see you back in blogland! It&#039;s always good to have a little break, and what better time of the year to get back to it! My word seems to be &quot;balance&quot;, since it&#039;s something I need for 2013.  Good for you in getting focussed on what you really want to do, looking forward to those book reviews too :)]]></description>
