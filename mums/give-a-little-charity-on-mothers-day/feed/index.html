		<description><![CDATA[One day you will be Australian of the year; no doubt about it Cath. Each month you add a little to brigthen our day, help make our kids happy and then put it all into perspective for us in the grand scheme of things. I hope for the day... no baby is born with HIV it&#039;s such a sad thing to contemplate as a mother. I cant afford the pack but some books are going out because of you and the messages you share xxxoo Happy Easter]]></description>
