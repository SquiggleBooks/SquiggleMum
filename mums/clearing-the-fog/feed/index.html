		<description><![CDATA[I could really relate to what you said about more family time - not so much &quot;more time&quot; but &quot;being present&quot;.

		<description><![CDATA[I really liked this post Cath.  &quot;For someone who only earns a little I sure work a lot!&quot;  Could so relate to this. I have getting organised to have a well over due online break soon.  It is so important to keep working at the juggling at that is working from home.

		<description><![CDATA[good to hear,  we want squigglemum not supermum.  I stopped blogging at the end of last year.  and it took a weight off my shoulders and I was not doing anywhere near the amount you were.  I stepped away from the computer got on my bike and have been making my life better.  I am finding that now I am happier those around me are too.

If you ever want to join me for a ride on a Saturday afternoon or morning let me know.  Im kidless on Monday nights and Saturday nights too if you ever want a girlie movie night in I can offer a venue, you can organise the girls.  We can even play Wii  lol.

I hope that both you and Damon will find happiness in your new free time and please please please dont use that time to say yes to something else.  Take a lesson from our 21month olds   NO is so easy to say.]]></description>
