		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,

I loved what you wrote.  I live in a blended family and to try and achieve my desire for our marriage to come first is paramount for me.  I believe that the marriage is the foundation of the family and from a strong marriage will flow a happy family.

However, given that two of the three children in my household are only here 50% of the time, it makes it difficult for my husband to have any time for his wife.  he wants to maximise the time he gets with the two daughters he only has custody of every other week and therefore I feel like I am a part-time wife.

I am interested in connecting with other mums who live in a blended family so as to develop a network of sounding boards and sanity checking friends.  So if there is any one out there who feels they are struggling with a blended family life style, please say hi.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be honest, I don&#039;t think we&#039;ve really decided yet. I&#039;ve heard Dr Phil (oh yes, I&#039;m going there, I do quote him from time to time exposing my secret reality tv shame) that children are just on loan (until they leave the nest).

And while I think it&#039;s important to spend time as a married couple and not just relate to one another as co-parents, I also think that with having a young child, her needs can&#039;t always wait. She doesn&#039;t necessarily have the capacity, because she&#039;s not even two, whereas my husband is an adult (most of the time).

So if we were planning a romantic evening and she&#039;s having a rough night, well she comes first. But just because I&#039;m attending to her needs doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m ignoring my husband - that&#039;s what he wants too.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a juggling act, all of it. That said, my husband and I work hard at loving each other. The reality is my children will (hopefully) grow up and move away but he is my life partner. I don&#039;t want to wake up beside a stranger one day. So we try to getaway just the 2 of us a couple of times a year and we work on not taking each other for granted. I adore my children passionately, but he comes first.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, my partner and I include our 4 yr old daughter in our celebrations. I don&#039;t think it has to be either/or necessarily.

She comes and celebrates our anniversary with us at the restaurant and yesterday Charlotte chose and gave the flowers to me for Valentines Day.

That works for both my partner and me. I do, however need to schedule more time with just Peter, but we&#039;re quite laid back about this.

I waited a long time to be a Mum and can&#039;t have anymore, so at such a young age, She deserves a fair bit of our attention. Don&#039;t worry, Charlotte knows when &#039;Daddy and I are having a conversation right now&#039; for instance. It&#039;s a tricky thing to balance, but each family works differently.

Christine :-)

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. I definitely agree with this, although, as you say, it can be difficult at times. My husband and I have struggled a little at times since our little girl was born, but it comes down to communication and making the effort. So cliche, but so true.

And the best gift I can give my daughter is a happy household and an example of a great relationship.
