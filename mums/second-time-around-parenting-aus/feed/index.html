		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d just like to say that as a mother of twins, you look positively tiny!! LOL In all seriousness, I carried my twins to 38 weeks and I was so enormous people actually stopped and stared open-mouthed at me. I was also the topic of many conversations as I walked by: How many weeks is she? She&#039;s got to be having twins, yeah?

It was quite hilarious and something I look back on with wonder. I love being pregnant, and having my twins was no exception. You look beautiful :)

		<description><![CDATA[So true... I&#039;ve been slack lately though and haven&#039;t been buying enough present or making enough fuss about friend&#039;s pregnancys. I&quot;m excited about it but probably not showing it enough!

I wanted to share the story of a friend of mine who was pregnant with her fourth baby a few years ago. This was going to be her fourth baby in just over three years. She was really struggling because they&#039;d planned on stopping at three because the load was already too much. It was a very very tough time for her - she&#039;s a wonderful, strong mother and woman and seeing her like that was really difficult.

I hadn&#039;t had my children yet so I didn&#039;t know that you only threw baby showers for the first baby, so I automatically got in touch with my sister-in-law and we threw her a surprise baby shower. We asked guests to buy things for her, instead of for the baby - we figured she already had enough of that!

Her fourth baby, a daughter just turned six and my friend still talks about that baby shower. She said it was such an amazing experience for her and that it really did help her through such a difficult time. She said it helped her realise that she did have people who loved her and that she wasn&#039;t alone in it.

I&quot;ll always be grateful for the fact that I was blissfully unaware that I was going against tradition by throwing a shower for baby #4. I had no idea how much it would mean to her.

PS - I love the photo too :o)

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, you are all tummy ;)

It is sad when, for some people, it is just another one.  By the time our fourth came around, we found it just as special as the other 3.

...and people still haven&#039;t stopped asking us if we are having more...

Kids are awesome.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well where else did you think he was going to go.  You are so tiny.  Not like me,  my kids hid under my ribs.  I wish I had a watermelon tummy to look pregnant instead of just fat.
