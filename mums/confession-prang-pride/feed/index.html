		<description><![CDATA[Hooray for SquiggleDad! Nothing worse than being trapped in your car with a young child. We got locked out of my dear MIL&#039;s house a couple of days before Thanksgiving...all three kids and a trunk full of groceries and no way into the house. Hubby was a hour away by car or he would&#039;ve come to our rescue. Luckily the nieghbors with the extra key came home before too long.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath, I too laughed reading your BLOG about this....not so much at you, more with you. Cos, I know how you feel! I did exactly that on my Birthday when Daniel and I were a new couple....he of course found it highly amusing, left work and came to &quot;save&quot; me too. All the other guys at work thought I was some air-head until they met me.... After I finished crying about it at the time it happened...I did end up having a fit of the Giggles! To make things worse my Dad found me a new door...the problem was it was BLUE! My car was white...just put that neon sign on my car...&quot;Stay away, she&#039;s pranged her door! All you unsuspecting poles take a step sideways! I park by feel!&quot;... I just hope you get a door that&#039;s the same colour as the rest of your car.
Love ya
xx

		<description><![CDATA[I reversed my car into the basketball hoop in the middle of my in-law&#039;s garden last Christmas and boy was my hubby cross!! He doesn&#039;t take those things very well so I&#039;m always nervous about telling him!

Good on SquiggleDad for being so great about your accident!

		<description><![CDATA[Oh ouch!!!

I&#039;ve done some not to bright things in my car also, like trying to go through a half opened gate in the dark and scraped all up one side of the car.

And losing control on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere by swerving for an animal(middle of nowhere meaning between my house and my friends house...I live in the country lol). Ended up with 2 tyres off the rims, bogged in the sand, 2 year old with no shoes, no phone reception and a 6km walk back to my friends house for help!

Yep, well all do it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I know I shouldn&#039;t.. But I&#039;m in a restaurant laughing so much I have tears in my eyes. I&#039;m sure it wasn&#039;t funny at the time, but it really was a mintie moment!

I did something like that when I left a newly bought dinner set on the roof of the car and drove off.. So embarrassing but so funny now to think of that smashing sound in the middle of the carpark!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We all do stuff like that at some stage! I find it pleasantly surprising when I don&#039;t get an agry response (or too much of a ribbing) from my partner.

Yay for Mr Squigglemum!]]></description>
