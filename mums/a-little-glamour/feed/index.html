		<description><![CDATA[I am definitely a little bit of glamour a lot of the time. If I don&#039;t get a bit of foundation and mascara on before the school drop off, its probably not going to happen! So I aim for that most days unless I&quot;m having a big clean or know I am not going anywhere.
I think a spray of perfume every day is in order though...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[3y 6m &amp; 2w ago I gave up on glamour.

The same day my daughter decided to start covering me in baby spew and poop.  lol   So I would probably be a #2.  It is getting better as Riley is getting older.  I actually put on some of my nice earings and a necklace the other day.  I also had my nails done.  What a treat, they only lasted about 2 days as we were back into the sand and playdough but was nice to go out to coffee with you and the girls feeling like a lady and not a mum.

		<description><![CDATA[I think it is so cool that you have two pairs of glasses, Cath, so that you can mix and match, what a great idea.

Thank you for your great tip.
