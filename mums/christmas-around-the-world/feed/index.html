		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a bit late, but...

* Which country do you live in? Melbourne Australia

* What is the current temperature? Approx 23C (you&#039;re likely to need a jumper for Christmas day)

* How do you prepare for Christmas?
by putting up the tree &amp; assorted decorations, make lists - lots of lists! Think about meaningful gifts for my family (what would they really appreciate), try to watch a christmas movie (cringe, i know..) and brace myself for all the food &amp; good times (i know... i&#039;m very lucky)

* What will you eat on Christmas Day?
generally a roast (hopefully with yorkshire puddings), cold ham, seafood, lots of salads &amp; cooked veggies. i may also cave &amp; be persuaded to dip into some lollies and red wine, but not together! this year we also had a swedish hot drink.

* What do you hope for at Christmas?
some quality time with the family and an understanding of how lucky we truely are.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Which country do you live in? Cleveland, Ohio, USA

What is the current temperature? Currently 23 F with snow but forcasting 42 F with Rain on Christmas

How do you prepare for Christmas?
Put up our tree, pull out my Santa Collection and other decorations for our (non-working) fireplace mantle, hang the stockings, do an advent calender, help the children prepare for the Christmas pageant at church, Go caroling with either church  or Girl Scouts, Put out our nativity (baby Jesus joins the scene Christmas day) Read lots of different Christmas stories from the library, this year we saw the new A Christmas Carol movie (with Jim Carey) and are reading the original book by Charles Dickens.  Also watch lots of Christmas TV specials (I love the year without a Santa Claus and the miser brothers and laugh hysterically at National Lampoons Christmas Vacation), Bake Christmas cookies with my girls.

What will you eat on Christmas Day?
Turkey, Stuffing, Sweet Potatoes, Mashed Potatoes, Cranberry Sauce, Vegetables (usually Green Beans).  Christmas Cookies for dessert and hopefully some egg nog (without alcohol).

What do you hope for at Christmas?
A peaceful day at home with my family.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. Which country do you live in? USA - Mississippi
   2. What is the current temperature?  in the mid 50&#039;s F, but a cold front is coming in so it should be nice and cold Christmas Day!
   3. How do you prepare for Christmas? Usually the day after Thanksgiving we put the Christmas tree up and the rest of the decorations follow. I have been so busy this year with my tassel business I haven&#039;t had time to finish unpacking all my decorations! Sigh.....there&#039;s always next year!
   4. What will you eat on Christmas Day? for breakfast our tradition is to make sausage balls...baking mix, sharp cheddar, and sausage, with a few more cheeses and spices thrown in to make it yummy. Dinner is usually baked ham, sweet potato casserole, green beans, rolls, and lots of yummy goodies!
   5. What do you hope for at Christmas? To spend as much time with my mother as possible. She has cancer and every Christmas with her I count as a gift.

As a side note, I have a friend who lives in Tasmania. We just talked last night! We set up our Skype at the same time so now it won&#039;t cost a thing to call her! I&#039;ve known her for about 17 years since I spent two months in Tassie in 1991. I&#039;d LOVE to go back. I think part of my heart is still in Oz!

		<description><![CDATA[1) Country: I&#039;m a Yank living in Sydney.
2) Temps: It&#039;s hot again today and will be throughout the season.
3) This is a festive season for our family. It started on Thanksgiving, last Thurs in November with family gathering with other mates from Sydney. Then we readied for Hanukkah, the Jewish festival of dedication. That done with menorah and candles and latkes and dreidels and family and friends. Then we put up the Christmas tree. It&#039;s a beaut. Family will gather again on Christmas Eve and then Christmas morning. I&#039;m almost weary just typing all this.
4) Eat? The food of the season keeps me going. Turkey and the fixings on Thanksgiving. Latkes and sour cream and applesauce on Hanukkah. Christmas, no prawns, but lots of great food with Chinese on Christmas Eve and a massive brisket and Texas potatoes and heaps more on Chrissy.
5) Hopes: Nothing about my own stocking. I&#039;m content. I hope my kids enjoy their life and that Jesus gets his rightful place in the holiday.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just discovered your blog.  This is fun =)

1. USA
2. 70 degree F
3. We start preparing on Dec. 1st by putting up the tree.  Then we do lots of fun family crafts and outings throughout the month.  We also do a Jesse tree at night to teach the kids about God&#039;s plan and why Christ&#039;s birth was important.  And I wrap a Christmas book for every night up until Christmas and so every night before bed, the kids take turns picking out one book from under the tree, unwrapping it, and we read it as our bedtime story.
4. We&#039;ll eat lots of turkey, sweet potatoes, dressing, and pies.
5. I hope for a fun and relaxing time as we spend time with extended family, and I hope that all kids will sleep well while on vacation =)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[# Which country do you live in? Canada
# What is the current temperature? -25 C
# How do you prepare for Christmas? We prepare all year long.  I star gift shopping/making on in January and hope to be done by Dec 1.  Rarely happens.  We switch over home school in December to Christmas lessons and we decorate on the last weekend in November.
# What will you eat on Christmas Day? Pancakes, Waffles, Bacon, Eggs and fruit or breakfast.  Turkey and trimmings for Supper.  Plus all the snacks and appys!
# What do you hope for at Christmas? I hope to shine Christ&#039;s light to my unsaved family and to have the Holy Spirit touch their heart and turn to Jesus.
Also a new lap top would be a bonus :)

		<description><![CDATA[1.Which country do you live in? Germany
2.What is the current temperature? Rain settled in today and the temp is up in the high 30&#039;s. It&#039;s been between 0 and 24 with lots of snow this week. The rain made the snow a muddy slushie mess.
3.How do you prepare for Christmas? With 2 little ones under 3, I&#039;m working on a Birthday Cake for Jesus. We sing Christmas songs- Away in a Manger is a favorite, as is Silent Night and O, Holy Night. We have a Christmas tree, and a nativity scene for decorations. There are Christmas Markets all over Germany that are so beautiful to see.
4.What will you eat on Christmas Day?  Ham or Turkey, haven&#039;t decided which yet. Sweet potato casserole. Homemade bread. Green beans. And a Birthday cake for Jesus!!
 5.What do you hope for at Christmas? Peace. Time to spend with family. Joy filled hearts. A welcoming heart. Tender smiles from little faces.
