		<description><![CDATA[I am so pleased that my macbook is nearly indestructible. The amount of times it has been hurled off the couch and I&#039;ve stopped breathing I can&#039;t even count. I thank the shell (made from one piece of aluminium). But I can&#039;t imagine I would react calmly if it was defaced!

		<description><![CDATA[So glad the marker came off.  I am like you, don&#039;t have many things that are just mine, but have a couple. Like my camera, which was ripped out of its bag and lenses were all over the floor.  I almost cried, luckily DH was there to check it all and put away.  DS1 had climbed up two cupboard shelves to get it.

		<description><![CDATA[Oh boy - sometimes when stuff happens and we I&#039;m not in the right frame of mind... I blow a fuse (especially when I&#039;m tired)... but you are right... stuff is stuff and it&#039;s usually not as bad as if first looks.

		<description><![CDATA[Oh Cath, I was right there with you all the way. My event involved scissors and my favourite sheets! - nothing a good stick on patch didn&#039;t fix.

&quot;When we detach ourselves from the outcome we can truly see the event for what it is&quot; (although I may have made up the words, this quote stems from any number of teachings - Buddhism, Yoga, Quantum Physics and of course, the Law of Squiggle!)
