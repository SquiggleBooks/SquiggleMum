		<description><![CDATA[My daughter was induced at 41w4d and the labour was AWFUL - 22 hours and lots of intervention. Sounds pretty similar to your first story - prostagladin gel, then waters broken, then drip, then epidural and ventouse. My son was threatening the same, but at 40w5d, he came naturally. My two labours were like chalk and cheese. My son was delivered in under 5 hours from start to finish - no pain relief and no intervention (apart from a couple of stitches). If I had never had my daughter&#039;s labour, I would be one of those people who say &quot;oh, childbirth, it&#039;s not THAT bad!&quot; But, I know it certainly can be THAT BAD!

		<description><![CDATA[My first two were both induced, first one because of complications, second because I was 41 weeks.  I still went through labour but my contractions were pretty intense and labour only lasted 1 hour for each of them. For my third that was natural and when labour started, I was already driving to the hospital for an appointment which was a very good thing as the drive to the hospital takes an hour. And once I arrived my third one took only 15 more minutes before he came out.]]></description>
