		<description><![CDATA[My husband is head of SOSE at a highschool, he puts weeks into preparing their ANZAC Day service every year.  Last year they worked out that the density of people in the hall for the service was the same as the soldiers in the trenches at Gallipoli.

My parents have always taken us to the dawn service.  I know several people who object to ANZAC Day because they think it glorifies war, but to me it&#039;s the day that reminds us of the true horrors.  Remembrance Day is special, but that&#039;s celebrating a victory, a relief and an ending.  ANZAC Day was the reality.

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s a difficult thing to understand what peace means when we have lived with nothing but peace. To stand up for the weak,the oppressed, is an honourable thing in any language, and applies to school yard bullying as much as it does to wars between countries.  To teach our children honour seems to me, a good solid thing to do as a parent.  Anzac Day seems a good day to begin.]]></description>
