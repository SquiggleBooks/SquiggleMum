		<description><![CDATA[We have never taken our kids to the Ekka. Too expensive, too crowded, too many germs, too much hassle to get there ...Miss 13 went for the first time last year with her aunt, uncle and cousin and had a whale of a time. I thought my sister and brother-in-law were very brave!!! We used to go to the Redlands Show each June, and the Strawberry Festival each September (both were held at the Cleveland showgrounds). These days they have amalgamated into the &quot;Spring Festival&quot; and yes, we usually end up going :-)

		<description><![CDATA[My poor, deprived children (not really) didn&#039;t get to go to the Ekka until last year when they were 9 &amp; 11.  We just aren&#039;t in to it, it had been 18 years since I had been.  Tegan was playing in 2 school bands at the Ekka this year so Tegan and I went for the day but we will go to Wet and Wild later in the year as a family.  Previously we have done Dreamworld (using flybuys) rather than going to the Ekka.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I prefer the local shows and fetes at this stage.  Avoiding the August winds and sickness are a reason why we haven&#039;t ventured to the Ekka yet! (Oh, and the cost of it!)  The kids have just as much fun at the smaller shows and will probably enjoy the Ekka more when they&#039;re older.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I too find the smaller shows less daunting.  We went to the Boonah Show earlier in the year.  I was shocked at how expensive the entry prices were (apparently I&#039;m still living in the 90&#039;s), but all round it was great to give our money to support the local community there.

		<description><![CDATA[I absolutely love the ekka! Went every year of my life... Until I was pregnany with baby 3! Now we just cant afford going... with the kids! It gets expensive for 4 kids, plus mum &amp; dad. Although, we were lucky and got free tickets this year, so hubby and I are heading in tomorrow.... WITH NO KIDS! Yay! We both got a day off work. It will be our first day together, with no kids in such a long long long time. I feel like a big kid in a lolly shop :)]]></description>
