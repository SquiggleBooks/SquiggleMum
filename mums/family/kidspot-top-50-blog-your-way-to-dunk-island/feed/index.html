		<description><![CDATA[Having done a fair few long haul flights to Europe to visit family with the kids since they were babies my top list is:

- I pack clothes for me and the kids in hand luggage for accidents that are bound to happen when travelling non stop for 30+ hours

- try and do as less planning as possible. The more you try and jam in during the holiday the more stressful the holiday will become (funny that!)

- I put aside a full day for packing before we go and a full day when we return to unpack and wash, get sorted etc. When jet lag is threw in I extend this to 2/3 days either side.

Sometimes I long for the day when holidays go back to me just throwing my clothes into a bag and taking off with only myself to worry about (not the clothes of 3 other people!). But guess the fact is everything has but a time and these days (holidays with the kids) will come to an end soon enough..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sticker activity books would have to be my number one &#039;to take&#039; item with toddlers and preschoolers.

Travelling with extended family or friends, or befriending a family with similar aged children once you are there is also a good way of &#039;sharing the load!&#039;

		<description><![CDATA[I like to make sure that when we get back from holidays, we have at least one full day with dad home, before he has to head back to work.  So if we get back Sunday, I make sure that he is home Monday.  Even if you wash when you are away there is generally lots to do when you get back. Having two adults around helps to share the workload!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Could relate to those tips!
My tip would be to pack an extra set of clothes for you and children on plane trips - in case of mishaps of all kinds!

And I always take on the plane little toys the kids haven&#039;t seen before or for a while that you can pull out one by one - I used to go for 1 toy/hr of travel when kids were tiny and put them all in a small container.  Those tiny size books are great too.

And a tip from my latest trip - take the sick bags from the plane if you have a child (like mine) that is that way inclined.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I loved this post Cath! It is so exactly the things we are just slowly learning! My only tip is a little boring - the accountant in me coming our here - but budgeting for your trip and trying to prepay as much of it before you go also adds to the relaxation experience.  It also means that you don&#039;t always feel like you are spending money and hopefully avoids any surprise expenses popping up to immediately stress you out and make you realise all the work you will have to do when you get home to pay for your holiday!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are usually visiting family on holidays, but even if we aren&#039;t we make up an itinerary before we go.  It doesn&#039;t have to be completely filled out, but it ensures that all the important things are covered and we&#039;re not rushing the last few days to fit everything in.  And we&#039;ve learnt the hard way to include a &#039;chillout&#039; day every week.

Another thing is to decide on clothes - are you taking lots and not washing, or taking the minimum?  If that&#039;s the case, make sure you schedule washing time in there!

		<description><![CDATA[Your tips nearly made me cry.  I think that might be a sign that a holiday is in order!

I particularly like your divide and conquer tip.  I&#039;m often feeling like I didn&#039;t get a real break.

On our last trip I did a fair bit of organising before we left.  I had a little notebook full of names and addresses of kid friendly eateries, parks, etc. on the way to our destinations.  If we needed to stop we knew where we could go and that the location would work for us.
