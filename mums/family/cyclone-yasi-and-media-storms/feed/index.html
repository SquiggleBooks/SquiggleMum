		<description><![CDATA[Great post and good advice.  With the floods, I had the tv on quite a lot, though when the children were at daycare.  It was odd the way it was almost addictive viewing, but at the same time was also saddened by exactly as you say - the way it was used for maximum drama.  Though I wanted as much information as possible I ended up turning to social media which was much more relevant and informative.  When the cyclone hit I was enroute to meetings interstate which I was in all day and completely missed the majority of the news coverage - though again got the updates which I cared about (how friends were doing) via sms &amp; social media.  I think the &quot;traditional&quot; media with its sensationalism is becoming much less relevant.  Thanks for also highlighting the effect that has on our children.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We had (mild) storms here in country WA on the weekend from Cyclone Bianca-we got caught in part of it-now my boys (5,3,2) are playing &quot;storms&quot; with Duplo. Building towns then knocking them over, like in the storm.  The littlest even hides under the table when the &quot;storm&quot; comes through.  We have turned the TV off as they are terrified.  Processing through play is very important.  I had no idea how much seeing trees get ripped up would effect them.  I feel for the kids in QLD!  Praying for you all over there.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[absolutely great advise.
Now that my children are 10, 9, 7 &amp; 3 - we tuck the 3 year old up in front of kids shows but no longer hide these disasters from the other 3.
We pray. we give generously to those affected - and include the kids so they learn to be generous. we reasure them- telling them they are safe here and now.
I am finding it interesting how parenting changes so quickly in so few years.
We also realise that the media do bleed whatever they can to boost ratings - and sometimes enough is enough and it&#039;s tv off.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Cath, would love you to pray for my parent&#039;s, Matt&#039;s parents, both of our grandparents, my sister and her husband and my four nephews under 4, and many of my cousins, uncles, aunts etc and soooooooo many friends in the Far North!  They have already lost power and are sounding quite frightened already - please let them all safe!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So true.  It&#039;s very easy to forget just how much they are taking in, even if it appears they aren&#039;t paying attention.  My son, at age 2.5 knows the term flood, but thankfully not all that it entails.  I have no idea how parents up north who have to experience this are going to prepare their kids for it.  Just what do you say?]]></description>
