		<description><![CDATA[We have a family &#039;Red faces&#039; night where the children and grown ups do some silly/serious acts for each other.   The children get to open one present (always new pj&#039;s- so that in the morning when I take photos of them opening their Christmas presents they are always wearing gorgeous jammies).  They have a shower, dress in their Christmas PJ&#039;s, go outside and sprinkle some magic reindeer food (despite the fact they know Santa is not real), lay out their stockings and then watch some of Carols by Candlelight before going to bed.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This year the kids and I are spending it at my parents house.  Best to make the most of the kids on christmas day as I only have them til 2 and I dont want their whole day taken up driving in the car around Brisbane.  It will be nice to have a mini holiday at their place.  Lots of swimming, baking, and prep for the big day.   So we will head over around 1 tomorrow.   Im sure my parents will love the joy of small kids to wake up to on Christmas day too.    Oh and im sure that the UNO cards will make an appearance as they are the only card games we know once the kids are asleep.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We go to our Christmas Eve church service. On the way home we admire the homes that have been decorated with &#039;Christmas&#039; lights. Then the boys head to bed while hubby and I fill stockings, do any last minute prep and watch the Carols on TV. Lovely ;)

		<description><![CDATA[Last year we opened our presents on Christmas Eve, simply because my husband was working from 6am-2pm on Christmas day, which meant he would miss presents and christmas lunch. We made it like our &quot;mini christmas&quot; with just the four of us, and had something simple, but a little special for dinner. This year (thank God) he doesn&#039;t work Christmas day, but we will still try to make the 24th special.]]></description>
