		<description><![CDATA[I plan to buy this book next time I am in Australia- I have read so many great reviews and of course love the blog associated with it!



ps: Sorry, this is based on your other post about Dirtgirl and playing outside- I didn`t want to comment there as I am no longer an Australian resident. I totally agree with you on playing outside during the cold weather- over the winter my older son got completely rugged up and played in the snow for the first time. We don`t see a lot of snow here in Chiba but we had a bit over the winter and it was nice for him to experience it. On the non snowy days he still enjoyed digging in the dirt in my in-laws garden and picking flowers. I saw dirtgirl for the first time when I was home in Australia over the summer- fab show! I hope my kids get into it when they are a bit older. From memory it was an Australian program right? The accents sounded Aussie- which I love! My boys only hear an Australian accent (and English in general) from me so when they do watch dvd`s I prefer them to be Australian based!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow, that sounds like a great book, I think Nicole could be my mentor! By the way, I have just stumbled upon your blog and think its terrific, have just started one myself and thought you might be interested in a post I did yesterday (since you are a bird nerd), if you have a chance to read it.:-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I need this book! I use my domestic chaos as an excuse to exit the house and get outdoors with the kids as often as possible. It would be even better if I could have my cake and eat it too. Particularly interested in a book like this written by a mummy blogger rather than someone whose life revolves around organising and having a perfect home. I definitely need to get better at balancing everything I&#039;m trying to do at the moment!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[would love to but will be at MOPS (on my 40th bday - and no doubt NOT very organised at all..... ) I will probably have raced out the door, left the house  a total mess, dishes in the sink, beds unmade, scrambled to get Year one child off to school as close to on time as possible (hopefully BEFORE the second bell), no doubt left something behind and have to head back home and be making up what i am meant to be talking about on the way all the while scrubbing peanut butter off my jeans and weetbix out of my hair and wondering where my 4 year olds other shoe is and wondering if i can get away with him wearing his sisters pink gumboots instead. Does she have a chapter on that?]]></description>
