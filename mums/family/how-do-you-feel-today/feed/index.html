		<description><![CDATA[Great post and a great reminder.
We had a little chat tonight about feelings.
What books have you read that talk about emotions - discuss emotional IQ?
Love to hear your comments.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[These are very helpful tips on dealing with children’s feelings. I think that showing them that it is okay and there is nothing to be ashamed of on sharing how they feel would increase their self-esteem. It is always important to be sensitive on what we say and do to a child.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you! I know this, but I really needed the reminder right now. We&#039;ve had a bit of school holiday squabbling last few days, and I&#039;ve been a bit guilty of playing down how they&#039;re feeling and trying to jolly them past it]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I never thought how I approach feelings with my son until I read this post.  He was looking a bit sad and down today so I made sure I asked how he was feeling.  Sometimes we need a good reminder to think about the things we do everyday without actually thinking about them!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this Cath. I always need this reminder. I am guilty of the &quot;don&#039;t be silly&quot; reaction in the heat of the moment. I need to remind myself that although something seems silly or insignificant to me, it doesn&#039;t feel that way as a 3 year old.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely post Cath.
We try our best to have this kind of language in our house too. Can be challenging, especially in the heat of the moment, but it&#039;s so important for our children to know that it&#039;s okay to feel angry/sad/scared as well as happy. We have the whole series of &quot;When I&#039;m Feeling&quot; books and they get lots of use in our house!]]></description>
