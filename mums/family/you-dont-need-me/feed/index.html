		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been thinking of starting a blog recently, but this is on top of running my business and being mum, friend, volunteer etc. One of the things that has stopped me from starting was this exact dilemma you have beautifully articulated. Thank  you for your honesty and thank you to your readers for demonstrating empathy. It&#039;s so encouraging!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It is so sad to hear of your friends loss.  Except the loss I had one of those weeks.  Husband overseas, me and the 3 kids had gastro, middle son either dislocated his elbow very severely or had a hairline fracture.  I had several orders run late due to all this and whilst I tried to keep my customers up to date there were still some not so happy responses.

My priorities last week were to get all of us better and healthy, with my business my second priority.

Hope things return to normal this week.]]></description>
