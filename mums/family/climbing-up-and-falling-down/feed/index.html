		<description><![CDATA[I was an avid climber and jumper from heights I climbed as a child. I always got in so much trouble whenever Mom heard my plop. She even had a minister come to talk me out of climbing and jumping because they thought I would get seriously hurt and it was unladylike...
I am so happy so see a Mom support a child&#039;s love of climbing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a scary experience! I tend to be a little to overprotective but reading your post has made me realise I should allow them to explore a little more. I grew up being allowed to do this in the country but in the city I find it hard to let then out of my sight.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh Hun, that must have been so scarey for you both. I can&#039;t image the fear that went through you during that moment she was unconcious.

I really hope this little fall doesn&#039;t impact her love of climbing trees but I&#039;m sure with a mummy like you she will be back up the trunk in no time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m glad you are all ok, and pleased you had the strength to not only see the message in this but to share it.
Kids deserve some independance and room to make (little) mistakes, learn and move on.
Plus, climbing trees is fun!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Concussions... seizures... oh my! Whenever I&#039;m concerned about my daughter climbing the tree in our yard I only ever think of broken limbs.

Glad to hear that your Miss 5 survived her tree fall without doing any &#039;major&#039; damage to herself.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So glad your daughter is ok. My little man is only 10 months old but already taking after his dad with his adventurous spirit. I hope I&#039;ll be brave like you. BTW this reminded me of all the stories my grandma told about my uncles falling out of trees etc while exploring, and how one of my uncles was at the hospital getting stitched up/bones reset so much he decided to go into medicine and is now an ER dr himself.]]></description>
