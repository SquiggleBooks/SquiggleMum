		<description><![CDATA[This is exaxtly what I was looking for! I have been searching the web for natural cleaning methods. There is one thing you didn&#039;t cover and that&#039;s washing clothes.
If you haven&#039;t tried them by now (I know this article and its responses are a few months old!) I would love you to try Soapnuts!! I sell them on by website. If you&#039;d like a free sample, please let me know and I&#039;ll post them to you! They&#039;re a natural tree berry and you use the shell to put in your washing machine to wash your clothes. You can also put them in the dishwasher and make a multipurpose cleaning liquid out of them to use as a shampoo, hand wash, wash your pets, spray and wipe, etc.
I love your site, it&#039;s fantastic! Thanks for the tips and keep up the fantastic work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Highly recommend the book &quot;Saving Money Made Easy&quot; by Cath Armstrong from www.cheapskates.com.au. Great cleaning recipes on page 162. I absolutely *swear* by the home made laundry spray, much more effective on stains and stinky underarms LOL! I also love the general purpose cleaning spray, and have just made and started using my first batch of washing powder. They&#039;re heaps cheaper too!

For sparkling clean glass shower screens I clean with a paste of bicarb soda and water. Bicarb (and vinegar if I feel like it!) is also fab for the toilet bowl!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I need to go green.  The cleaner we use for the shower is so strong that my hubby has to do it - although maybe that&#039;s a good thing?!

I have a few microfibre cloths and used them for a while but I worry that using water isn&#039;t really getting things clean.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Clove oil is even more effective on mould than Tea Tree oil. We cleaned all our bathroom ceilings (11 ft, 85 years old) with a mixture of clove oil and vinegar, all the mould was gone. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great tips - with my first wet season about to start I think I will stock up on Tea Tree oil and I am told clove oil does the trick too.
Hope I can find borax at our supermarket.
Read you later x]]></description>
