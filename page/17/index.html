		<div><strong>While I&#8217;m away at the Australasian <a href="http://mops.org.au">MOPS</a> Conference, the super-lovely Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a> is guest posting for me: </strong></div>
<div style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/finemotor_sand2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4079" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/finemotor_sand2.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></a><br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div style="text-align: left"><span>Sometimes as parents we are in a rush to help our children conquer the ‘big’  milestones, like learning to read and write.  In our haste we  sometimes forget about spending time working on the smaller steps which are  just as important for our children to master along the way.  Just as  learning to stand and cruise the furniture is a normal part of learning to walk,  learning to write will be a much easier process for children who have had lots  of opportunities for fun and playful practise of fine motor  skills.  Handwriting will be much harder for a child who does not have  reasonable control over a pencil or good co-ordination of what the brain thinks,  the eye sees and the hand does.</p>
<p>When we think of fun ways with fine motor skills, puzzles, bead threading and  building with blocks are usually the first activities to come to mind however  some children have little interest in any, or all of, these.  For these  children especially, looking outside the box for fun ways to develop fine motor  skills is really important and there are plenty of opportunities to be had in  all types of interesting places!</p>
<p><strong>15 Places to Find Fine Motor Fun</strong></p>
<p><strong>At the beach</strong></p>
<p>Try writing special messages to each other in the damp sand with your  fingers.  Or get collecting, looking for shells with holes in them as they  are perfect for threading onto string to make a simple bracelet or necklace, or  hang your strings in the window to remind you of Summer all year long.</p>
<p><strong>At the hardware store</strong></p>
<p>Screwing together nuts and bolts, locking padlocks with mini keys and sliding  latches all make for hours of concentration and fine motor fun, especially with  preschoolers.  An easy lock board can be made by securing a combination of  locks and latches to a small piece of peg board.</p>
<p><strong>At the garden nursery</strong></p>
<p>Bring home a seed packet or two of potted colour and have fun poking finger  holes into your soil and then dropping one seed into each hole, it’s trickier  than you think <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p><strong>In your sewing room</strong></p>
<p>Make a <a href="http://www.childhood101.com/2010/09/our-toddler-friendly-sewing-basket.html" target="_blank">simple  toddler friendly sewing project</a> using an embroidery hoop and plastic drawer  liner.  Add a plastic needle or metal bodkin threaded with a colourful  piece of wool, tying one end of the wool to the needle and the other through the  a hole in the drawer liner.  Teach your child to push the needle through  and pull until the wool is taut.  Preschoolers might like to embroider  around simple shapes drawn onto the drawer liner with marker pen.</p>
<p><strong>At the park</strong></p>
<p>Find a patch of daisies and teach your preschooler the simple childhood joy  of making daisy chain necklaces or crowns.</p>
<p><strong>Whilst singing</strong></p>
<p>Finger plays are not just fun to sing, doing the actions is great fine motor  fun as well.  Start with <em>The Incy Wincy Spider, Here is the Church,  Round and Round the Garden, Pat A Cake, Pat A Cake, 1-2-3-4-5 Once I Caught a  Fish Alive, Here is the Beehive</em>… a Google search will help you find many,  many more.</p>
<p><strong>By the washing line</strong></p>
<p>Pegging clothing is a quite a tricky skill when you really think about the  co-ordination involved.  Set up a little clothes line and let your toddler  or preschooler wash their dolls clothes and peg them out to dry.</p>
<p><strong>In a tub of water</strong></p>
<p>Give your toddler a tub of soapy water, a small cloth and a collection of  interesting shells to wash.  What toddler doesn’t love playing with  water?</p>
<p><strong>At the breakfast table</strong></p>
<p>Cereal isn’t just good for eating, hole-y cereal, like Cheerios, is also fun  to thread.  A Cheerio necklace could just be the new answer to breakfast on  the go!</p>
<p><strong>In the playground</strong></p>
<p>Why not introduce your preschooler or kindergartener to the childhood fun of  a game of marbles?</p>
<p><strong>In the shed</strong></p>
<p>Give your child a sorting tray and a jar containing an assortment  of screws or bolts of varying sizes – large, medium and small, and ask  him/her to sort them into the tray according to size.</p>
<p><strong>In the kitchen</strong></p>
<p>Who would think fine motor skills could be found in a batch of biscuit  dough?  Rolling dough, cutting with cookie cutters and decorating with  icing and sprinkles all involve varying degrees of motor control.</p>
<p><strong>For the Christmas tree</strong></p>
<p>With Christmas closer then we like to think, why not get a head start on the  decorations and make some <a href="http://www.craftbits.com/project/orange-cloves-christmas-ball" target="_blank"><span style="color: #669966">clove covered oranges</span></a> to hang in your home. They will  look festive and smell great.  Another simple Christmas craft idea,  suitable for preschoolers (under supervision) is to make tree decorations  by pushing small round head pins through a sequin and into a polystyrene  ball.</p>
<p><strong>Whilst you are cleaning</strong></p>
<p>Give your child a spray bottle of water and point them in the direction of  any windows which need cleaning.  Wiping the water off with paper or a  cloth is also good for large motor development.</p>
<p><strong>On your games shelf</strong></p>
<p>Grab out the dominoes and get busy making paths to knock down.  Early  primary school aged children will enjoy the challenge of trying to make card  houses from a deck of cards; also great for developing concentration, patience  and task persistence.</p>

<p><strong>The Joys and Challenges of Writing for Children</strong></p>
<p>I set my dreams to become a published author in motion just over four years ago. After having my second child, I thought I could become an author by simply writing while the kids slept. Naive, I know, but these are the slender foundations dreams are often built on.</p>
<p>Now, four years later, I have had my very own picture book, <em>Puggle’s Problem</em>, published (by Wombat Books). It’s a story about a baby echidna, a puggle, who can’t get his spines. Even though echidnas are Australian animals, I’ve found that not many people actually know what a puggle is. But I’m quickly changing that.</p>
<p>As well, the first instalment in my new series for girls aged seven and over, <em>Totally Twins: Musical Mayhem</em>, was released by New Frontier Publishing in September. It will be followed by the second book in the series, <em>Totally Twins: Model Mania</em>, due out in November.  Besides these three releases in 2010, I have a further 10 books due out in the next 2 years. So, I guess you could say I’ve found my niche in writing for children. And I simply love it. It’s a career loaded with joys and rewards, and yes, the occasional challenge. To kick off, here’s my shortlist of joys:</p>
<p>1.       First and foremost, writing for children is FUN. You have a great deal of freedom in terms of what you can write for kids to entertain, educate and inspire them. So many themes and topics, so many genres, including the wonderful realm of fantasy, which allows a writer to do some amazing world building and wish fulfillment.</p>
<p>2.       I love how I can play with language in picture books. I love their simplicity yet complexity, their rhythm and their rhyme.</p>
<p>3.       Picture books don’t have a lot of text, so they must be easy to write, right? Well, not quite, but they are the perfect literary medium to dip into and out of while still attending to the many duties of motherhood. A picture book text is way easier to memorise and rework inside your head than a full length novel. Trust me.</p>
<p>4.       I adore having my work illustrated. It’s stick figures only for me when I attempt to draw anything, but because I write for children, I have the joy of seeing my words &#8211; and my worlds &#8211; brought to life by some of the most talented artists in Australia. What a gift!</p>
<p>5.       In my books, I can relive my own childhood memories and experiences. I can share things that happened to me with others. Through my characters I can repair or change mistakes I may have committed in my past. And sometimes, I can just let my imagination take over and create completely new stories.</p>
<p>6.       I love visiting schools and libraries to talk about my writing to kids, to have them listen to my stories, to make them laugh and hear them say how much they enjoyed my stories or liked a particular characters. Kids give great, honest, valuable feedback about your writing.</p>
<p>7.       Children’s authors in Australia are a friendly and supportive bunch of people. It’s a fabulous industry to work in.</p>
<p>8.       Finally, I adore my driving aim, which is to write stories that appeal to kids. Stories that might be silly and funny and free. Stores kids will take to their hearts and read over and over again. Just as any good book should be.</p>
<p>So, that’s the joys of writing for children in a nutshell. On the flipside, there are challenges. My Top 3 would be:</p>
<p>1.       Perhaps not being taken as seriously as people who write for adults.</p>
<p>2.       Sometimes it’s hard to reach your audience, which for me is 3 &#8211; 6 year olds and 7 &#8211; 12 year olds, depending on whether it’s a picture book or junior novel.</p>
<p>3.       Juggling the demands of motherhood and a career in children’s writing that is beginning to be full time.</p>
<p>For me, the joys of writing for children far, far outweigh any challenges. I’m lucky and happy that I can now call myself a published author. That children are reading and embracing my books. I wouldn’t change what I’m doing for all the world, because writing for children <em>is</em> an utterly joyous occupation.</p>

		<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stick_sculpture2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4057" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stick_sculpture2.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>After <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/boys/birthday-boy-and-bear/">Mr 2&#8217;s birthday</a> there were lots of new and exciting gifts to open.  Several toys were wired into boxes with clear coated wires about 20cm each in length.  I kept them, figuring they would come in handy for something.  It&#8217;s a teacher thing &#8211; we can&#8217;t help ourselves!!</p>
<p>The kids collected a nice bunch of sticks from the backyard the other day, and we played around with them for a while before deciding to turn them into a &#8220;sculpture&#8221;.  (This is a word Miss 4 knows from visiting the Art Gallery and exploring different mediums with her artist-Nanna.)  My daughter&#8217;s first suggestion was to attach the sticks to each other with sticky tape.  We discussed whether sticky tape would hold very well to the bark and wood, and decided string would be better.  When we went to get some string, we discovered the wires!  Perfect!!</p>
<p>Wiring the sticks together was fiddly for a four year old, but fantastic for fine motor skill development.  She put the sticks and wires where she wanted them, and I just tightened up the joints.  It was also her idea to add some feathers into the joints, and I think the final result is rather lovely.</p>
<p>The sculpture is sitting on top of a skinny cabinet in the hallway just beside the back door.  This Ikea cabinet is fabulous because everyone in the family has their own drawer for outside boots and hats!  The birdcage decals run right along the hallway, so my daughter&#8217;s addition of feathers to the sticks seems just right.</p>

<p>We had an unexpected visitor to our backyard in the form of a tame <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgerigar">Budgerigar</a>.  The poor thing was being swooped by our resident <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_Miner">Noisy Miners</a> and seemed unable to fly away.  We could see an identification band around its leg, so assumed it was someone&#8217;s pet.</p>
<p>Using a towel we carefully caught the bird without frightening it.  The only container we had to put the budgie in was the one we also used for the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">frog</a>!  A little on the small side &#8211; but safer than staying in the yard.  Then of course, we had to decide what to do with it.</p>
<p>We printed some simple signs saying FOUND &#8211; YELLOW BUDGIE and a contact number.  Then we walked around our street and put the signs onto telephone poles and into letterboxes.  When we didn&#8217;t hear from anyone for 24hrs we took the bird down to our local vet.</p>
<p>There was so much learning involved in this whole process, and I was able to ask the kids questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of bird is it?</li>
<li>Do you think it&#8217;s wild, or someone&#8217;s pet?</li>
<li>Why do you think it can&#8217;t fly away?</li>
<li>Why shouldn&#8217;t we keep it?</li>
<li>How might the bird be feeling?</li>
<li>What might the bird need to be more comfortable?</li>
<li>How might the bird&#8217;s owner feel?</li>
<li>How far might the bird have come?</li>
<li>How could we find the owner?</li>
<li>What should we write on our sign?</li>
<li>What will we do if we can&#8217;t find the owner?</li>
<li>What do you think the budgie&#8217;s name might be?!</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope our feathered friend has been reunited with its owner <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

		<p><strong><em>Dear Sad Lady,</em></strong></p>
<p><em>We saw you eating sushi at the shops today.  You were sitting with two kids and you were crying on the phone.  Did you hear some bad news?  Or was it just a bad day?  Did someone let you down?  Or were the kids just being a handful?</em></p>
<p><em>We saw you, sad lady.  We were going to stop and see if you were ok, but we decided you needed flowers.  So we bought you some.  Pink roses.  Just a little bunch.  We got them as fast as we could and raced back to the sushi place.</em></p>
<p><em>But you were gone.</em></p>
<p><em>So we didn&#8217;t get to tell you that we noticed.  We didn&#8217;t get to let you know that strangers care.  We didn&#8217;t get to brighten your day.  And we&#8217;re sorry.</em></p>
<p><em>You will probably never read this.  But maybe sharing the story will inspire someone else to buy pink roses for a stranger.</em></p>
<p><em>With blessings,</em></p>
<p><strong><em>SquiggleMum and Kids.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; here are your roses:</em></p>

<p style="text-align: center">Matthew 25: 34-40 (NIV Bible)</p>
<p>&#8220;Then the King will  say to those on his right, &#8216;Come, you who are blessed by my Father&#8230; For I was  hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me  something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me.&#8217;</p>
<p>Then  the righteous will answer him, &#8216;Lord, when did we see you hungry and  feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?&#8217;</p>
<p>The King will reply, &#8216;I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.&#8217;</p></blockquote>

		<p>I was on my favourite local radio station this morning <a href="http://96five.com">96five</a> talking about the importance of outdoor play. Click on this link or the image below to <a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=7407">hear a podcast of the interview</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=7407"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/965_logo.png" alt="" width="140" height="95" /></a></p>
<p>If you are looking for simple outdoor play ideas while the kids are on holidays, try some of these:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Ideas for Under 5s</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/muddy_boy.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4009" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/muddy_boy-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mud pies &#8211; set up a simple <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/getting-dirty-in-outdoor-kitchens/">dirt kitchen</a> and let the kids cook with mud. Give them some utensils and bowls and they&#8217;ll be happy. Mine love using patty pans too (though they get soggy pretty quickly).</li>
<li>Digging &#8211; kids love to play in sand, but don&#8217;t stress if you don&#8217;t have a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/backyard-sand-play/">sandpit</a>.  Let the kids have a corner of the garden to dig up the soil.  There are all kinds of interesting things to be found underground.</li>
<li><a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/learning-in-the-rain/">Rainy play</a> &#8211; everything to a toddler is magical in the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/learning-in-the-rain/">rain</a>. Colours are stronger, surface textures change, there are new smells and sounds and tastes in wet weather.  Gumboots are a necessity.  Raincoats recommended, but depends on the climate.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Ideas for Over 5s</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong> </strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/green_girl.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-4010" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/green_girl-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/garden-in-a-week/">Plant</a> something &#8211; kids love participating in the whole process of growing things in the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/garden-in-a-week/">garden</a>. It&#8217;s even better if you plant something that has an end product to enjoy (like flowers, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/garden-in-a-week/">veggies or herbs</a>).</li>
<li>Climb trees &#8211; didn&#8217;t you <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">climb trees</a> as a child?  If you don&#8217;t have a suitable tree in your backyard, find a park that has some climbable trees.  If you are nervous about allowing your child this freedom, have a read of my recent popular post about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">tree climbing</a>.</li>
<li>Creature Hunt &#8211; encourage kids to find the wildlife in their local area. Some kids will love bug hunting and enjoy using a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/collections-up-clos/">magnifying glass</a>, while others will be more focused on <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">catching creatures</a>!  If you have an avid tree climber, you could let them take binoculars up the tree to investigate <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/my-budding-birder/">birds</a> too.</li>

		<p>Some days my children are gorgeous.  They play nicely together.  They make each other laugh.  They share adventures.  They create things.  They listen and follow instructions.  And I look at them and think I must be doing something right.</p>
<p>Some days my children are a handful.  They rile each other up.  They have tantrums.  They are disobedient.  They break things.  They draw on walls.  And I look at them and wonder what I&#8217;m doing wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wall_drawing.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3977" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wall_drawing.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>I love my children on the good days.  <strong>I love them just the same on the hard days</strong>.  My love for them is not dependent on their behaviour.  I love them because they are mine.  Nothing they could do could make me love them more.  Nothing they could do could make me love them less.</p>
<p>My children are so much like me.  Some days I am gorgeous. Some days I am a handful.  I too am loved unconditionally &#8211; by the One who is perfect. His love for me is not dependent on my behaviour.  He loves me because I am His.  Nothing I could do could make Him love me more.  Nothing I could do could make Him love me less.</p>
<p><strong>That kind of love frees me from the impossible pursuit of perfection.  I am free to be imperfect. And so are my kids. </strong></p>

		<p style="text-align: center">Birthdays are special.  They are all about&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/party_invites1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3962" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/party_invites1.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="310" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Inviting friends (and their bears) to share in the fun</strong>.  I chose these fun invitations and thank you tags from <a href="http://nomie.com.au/">Nomie Boutique Stationery</a>.  (I kind of left ordering the invites til the last minute, but Naomi had the invites ready in less than two days, and offered express postage. Phew!  I was delighted with the service I received from <a href="http://nomie.com.au/">Nomie</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2767.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3921" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2767.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Opening presents. </strong>One year olds don&#8217;t really get the whole present thing, but two year olds?  Bring it on!  We hung a green mosquito net to create a jungle present tent for the party.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2828.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3922" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2828.jpg" alt="" width="321" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Party food. </strong>Jelly in jungle colours, fruit skewers, banana lollies, fairy bread and teddy cupcakes.  The jelly was a hit with the adults too&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/birthday_cake1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3955" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/birthday_cake1.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Cake!!</strong> I think I&#8217;m improving.  Yes, I baked the cake from scratch.  Yes, I made the icing from scratch too.  Yes, I did it all by my own self.  Yes, I was a teensy bit proud.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2851.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3924" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/IMG_2851.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="321" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Blowing out candles.</strong> Despite practising ALL week, he needed a little help from big sis to blow the candle out.  She was only too happy to oblige, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/birthday_bearfood.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3959" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/birthday_bearfood.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="401" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Individuality</strong>.  I think a party should reflect the person being celebrated.  It&#8217;s not about putting on the best show for the guests.  It&#8217;s about saying &#8220;<em>we love the things that make you unique and special</em>.&#8221;   My son <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/boy-and-bear/">loves his bear</a>, so bears were part of the jungle fun.  Kids could make their bear some morning tea out of playdough, and give their bear a ride in the shoe-box swings.  We didn&#8217;t have games, because it&#8217;s not his style.  Instead we had balls to kick around, the bear activities, and jungle vines (crepe paper with leaves) hanging for decoration.  He loved it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/birthday_boxes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3956" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/birthday_boxes.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Learning to say thank you.</strong> This is really important to me.  Receiving gifts shouldn&#8217;t be an expectation, and thanks shouldn&#8217;t be dependent on the size of the gift.  Every gift is appreciated and my son hugged everyone after opening their gift.  We also gave out party boxes to kids as they left.  We decorated noodle boxes with jungle vines and attached the swing tags from <a href="http://nomie.com.au/">Nomie</a>.</p>

		<p>I picked up these wooden, unpainted creatures at an art supply store for only $2 each.  I think one is actually a lizard, but we called them both dinosaurs.  The kids loved the way the cuts in the wood enabled the creatures to move.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wooden_dinosaurs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3931" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/wooden_dinosaurs.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" /></a></p>
<p>I set up some paints in egg cartons and let the kids go for it!  My little one just needed me to hold his dinosaur still for him, but apart from that he painted it all by himself.  Here is his effort:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/painted_dinosaur1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3932" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/painted_dinosaur1.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="405" /></a></p>
<p>And here is big sister&#8217;s.  She was more deliberate with her placement of colours, and made sure that the underside was painted too:</p>

<p>I think they turned out rather well, don&#8217;t you?  Watch out if you visit our backyard. Dinosaurs roam the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">creek bed</a>&#8230;</p>
