<p>The entertainment industry is in mourning following the death of more than one celebrity this week.  Of course it&#8217;s sad when people die.   It&#8217;s devastating for their families and for those who knew and loved them.   But a tragedy?   I&#8217;m not so sure&#8230;</p>
<p>I understand that Michael Jackson made a significant contribution to the music scene over an extended period of time.   But does that make his life, or his death, more important than another person&#8217;s?   I&#8217;m just saying let&#8217;s keep some perspective.</p>
<p>Every six seconds a child dies from hunger or related causes.   That means that three kids have probably died while you&#8217;ve been reading this post.   Three mothers have had to say goodbye to a child they carried within them, gave birth to, nursed and loved.   <strong>On the day that one superstar died, sixteen thousand super little kids died too.</strong> No paramedics came, no paparazzi documented the occasion, there was no extended news coverage, and the world didn&#8217;t mourn for them.   They didn&#8217;t get fifty years to live.   Most of them didn&#8217;t make it to five.   We&#8217;ll never know if they might have been musical geniuses themselves, because they died of <strong>hunger</strong>.   To me, that&#8217;s a tragedy.</p>
<p>The king of pop said this:<br />
<em>Heal the world, make it a better place<br />
For you and for me and the entire human race<br />
There are people dying, if you care enough for the living<br />
Make a better place for you and for me.</em></p>
<p>The Bible says this:<br />
<em>Then the King will say&#8230; &#8216;Come, you who are blessed by my Father; take your inheritance&#8230; For I was hungry and you gave me something to eat, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you invited me in, I needed clothes and you clothed me, I was sick and you looked after me, I was in prison and you came to visit me&#8230;  I tell you the truth, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.&#8217;</em> (Matt 25:34-40)</p>
<p>What do you say&#8230;?</p>

<p>I set my daughter up with a paper plate, toddler-scissors, a glue stick, and a bunch of supermarket catalogues.  There is quite a lot to take in on those pages!  She loves looking through them and deciding what she&#8217;d like to have for her pretend dinner.  Then she snips them out and glues them onto her plate.  It&#8217;s a great activity for practising cutting skills, and because it&#8217;s so simple she really doesn&#8217;t need any help at all.  I love activities she can complete independently.</p>
<p>You could take this activity one step further by talking to your child about healthy eating.  Conversation about food groups and making good nutritional choices is likely to happen naturally, so take advantage if the moment arises.</p>
<p>This activity entertains my three year old for about half an hour, and costs next to nothing.  (If you don&#8217;t have paper plates in your craft box, just cut a cardboard circle out of a cereal box instead.  Then it really will be a free activity!)  There you have it.  Next time your letterbox is overflowing with junkmail catalogues, don&#8217;t think of it as an inconvenience but rather as a helpful delivery of free craft supplies for your toddler!</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re scared as a mother, who do you run to?  When the noise of life is overwhelming, where do you turn?  When life is raining down around you, where do you seek shelter?  I know where I go.  Hope you do too.<br />

<p>I remember this moment.  She looked at me like she was sure with all of her little heart that she belonged to me, and I thought my heart might burst. On the days when she is infuriating, or frustrating, or defiant or just plain difficult &#8211; this is the photo I flick back to in my mind.  She will always be the little girl who took my breath away with her baby smile, and as I tell her often, I will always love her &#8220;to the stars and back.&#8221;</p>
<p>If these lovely mums would like to play along, I&#8217;d love to see their favourite photos.  You might like to check out their blogs&#8230;</p>

<p>I was seriously lacking culinary inspiration this afternoon, and a quick peek in the freezer confirmed that my options for dinner would be mince, mince or mince.  So boring, I&#8217;m snoring.  So I did what any modern mama would do.  I asked the twitterverse for help.</p>
<p>I waited, and waited (for like two whole minutes), until finally an answer came, and it was a great one.  Relieved, I tweeted:  <em><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Just when I was thinking all my peeps must be &#8220;above&#8221; mince, @<a href="http://twitter.com/MitzyG">MitzyG</a> saves the day <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />  Thanks!!!</span></span></em></p>
<p><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">After that comment the tweets came thick and fast.  It seemed everyone was keen to participate in the mince conversation.  Other mums either wanted to share a favourite recipe that works with their kids, or wanted a little inspiration for the mince sitting in their own freezers!  In the end I decided to cook stuffed tomatoes as MitzyG first suggested.  I will now forevermore consider her, affectionately, Mitzy the Mince Maven. </span></span></p>

<p>We were having a lazy Saturday morning all together.  My hubby was playing with our 8 month old son on our bed.  They were laughing, tickling, making silly noises, and just generally having a bit of baby rough-and-tumble when WHAM!  Little man&#8217;s hand connected with Daddy&#8217;s nose and there was more than a trickle of blood.  <em>All over my very white, very lovely 300TC quilt cover! </em>I tried to attend to my poor injured husband, but to be honest I was more concerned about my poor linen!!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting observing the similarities and differences between my daughter and son at the same age.  I have to say that my notions about nature and nurture are being somewhat challenged.  Boys really are built differently to girls.  My son loves to play with the same toys my daughter did, but not in the same way.  He loves noise!  The first thing he does with any toy is bash it on the ground to see what noise it makes.  And when he&#8217;s bashed each toy individually on the floor, he starts bashing different toys against each other to see  what <em>that </em>will do!  His displays of affection are far less gentle than his sister&#8217;s were too.  Her baby-kisses were soft and sloppy.  His are like a slobbery missile!  Perhaps there is more truth to the stereotype about boys being more physical than girls after all&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently read the highly acclaimed <em>Raising Boys </em>by Steve Biddulph but I&#8217;d love some opinions from other mums with boys.  Are they rougher by nature, or is is more to do with the way we parent them?  And how do we make sure our sons get a healthy amount of the rough-stuff without becoming bullies?</p>
<p>(By the way, it looks like my quilt will make a full recovery.  Oh, and my hubby&#8217;s fine too.)</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-852" title="img_6568" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_6568-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6568" width="300" height="225" />Last week I posted <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/10-tips-for-finger-painting/">ten tips for fingerpainting</a>, and one of my readers suggested a great follow on activity &#8211; thanks <a href="http://picklebums.com">Kate</a>!  As promised we gave it a go.  I guess it&#8217;s technically a very basic lithograph, but we just called it reverse finger painting.  Here&#8217;s what we did.</p>
<p>Lithographs were originally done on a smooth stone or metal surface so we began hunting for something suitable.  After ruling out a few potential suspects around the kitchen, we settled on baking trays.  To aid with cleanup we covered the trays with aluminium foil, spreading it out as smoothly as possible.  (Wrinkles in the foil will show up in the paintings).  I figured that the edges of the trays would help to contain the mess.</p>
<p>We put a big blob of paint into the middle of the tray, and I spread it out smoothly and evenly with a wide, flat paintbrush (a bit challenging for toddlers).  Then my daughter drew a picture directly into the paint with her fingers.  She just LOVED it!  When she was happy with her artwork, we carefully put a piece of paper down over it and gently smoothed it over the paint.  My three year old was so surprised to see the &#8220;reverse&#8221; image on the page when we lifted it up.  She was hooked after the first print.  I just respread the paint between images, and she happily painted (or unpainted&#8230;?!) the afternoon away.</p>
<p>I must admit this activity exceeded my expectations.  It was less messy than traditional finger painting, and when we were finished all I had to do was peel off the alfoil and throw it away.  It was also more successful than I anticipated.  It certainly held my three year old&#8217;s attention, and the pictures turned out very well.  Interestingly, she wasn&#8217;t at all worried about working with a single paint colour.  She never once said, &#8220;Mummy I need green for the leaves&#8230;&#8221;  I think that because she wasn&#8217;t overwhelmed by colour choices she was able to focus on shapes.</p>
<p>We really had a fun time together with this activity.  I would definitely recommend that you give reverse finger painting a try with your kids!  And you know I want to hear about it if you do&#8230;</p>

		<div id="attachment_816" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-816" title="janelle_june" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/janelle_june-249x300.jpg" alt="janelle_june" width="249" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Janelle + 3 kids + 1 supportive hubby</p></div>
<p>Have you seen the funky designer cards and stationery at <a href="http://earthandink.com">Earth &amp; Ink</a> yet?  Janelle Keys is the creative force behind this gorgeous, environmentally friendly range, and she&#8217;s my Real Aussie Mum for June!  She started her <a href="http://www.picturethisgraphics.com.au">graphic design business</a> after eight years in the print industry, and now happily juggles motherhood with her own rapidly growing business.  Her three kids are aged 6, 4 and 3.  Here are her five faves:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Favourite outing with kids:</strong> Every school holidays our local library shows free movies.  The kids grab their pillows and bags of movie munchies and we sprawl out on the library floor.  It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s fun, and it&#8217;s a great way to enterain the kids!</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with the kids:</strong> I don&#8217;t get to do it often, but I do love playing hide and seek indoors with the kids.  It&#8217;s a game that has us all laughing, and on those days when I seem to do a lot of work, it&#8217;s good just to turn the computer off for twenty minutes and have some fun.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal</strong>:  The humble spaghetti bolognaise is definitely one meal that will please everyone &#8211; which is fine by me!  I make it choc-full of grated veggies so I know the kids are getting a healthy meal.  It&#8217;s also my personal favourite because I make a double quantity of the bolognaise sauce,  leaving plenty for another meal during the week.  And that means a night off cooking (yay)!</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories</strong>:  I remember when my eldest son loved to hear &#8220;Cat in the Hat&#8221; every night.  I could almost recite it!  At the moment my daughter is really loving her &#8220;Letters from the King&#8221; devotion each night where she is learning how to be a real Princess.  I think it&#8217;s helping control some of those 4 year old tantrums&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down</strong>:  Friday night is my favourite time, knowing that I don&#8217;t have any client deadlines the next day.  I enjoy just watching tv with a good cup of tea.  It&#8217;s not much, but knowing that I don&#8217;t have to do anything for anyone is great!</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-830" title="drawingday_today" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/drawingday_today-300x241.jpg" alt="drawingday_today" width="300" height="241" />Did you know that tomorrow is <a href="http://drawingday.org">Drawing Day</a>?  I could put this post up tomorrow, but then you wouldn&#8217;t have time to think about which drawing idea you&#8217;d like to try with your kids &#8211; and participate!  As the daughter of an artist, I grew up with lovely materials to draw with and art was valued.  Here are 10 different materials you could try with your kids tomorrow to participate in Drawing Day:</p>
<p>1.  Draw with charcoal &#8211; I remember doing this one with Mum.  It was messy (not that it bothered us), but exciting to draw with something so different.</p>
<p>2.  <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/chalk-it-up/">Draw with chalk </a>- head outside and draw all over the footpath!  It will wash away with the next rain.</p>
<p>3.  Draw with watercolour pencils &#8211; using watercolour pencils adds an extra dimension to kids&#8217; drawings.  They love seeing the image change as they brush water over their lines.</p>
<p>4.  Draw in the sand &#8211; give each child a stick and let them go for it!  Sandy beaches are a huge, blank canvas just waiting for budding artists.  (Yes, I know&#8230; most of Queensland&#8217;s beaches have all but washed away at the moment.)</p>
<p>5.  Draw in shaving cream &#8211; this is a great one for littlies.  Buy the cheapest can of shaving cream you can find.  Squirt some onto an outdoor table, and let your toddler swirl their little fingers through it.  If you don&#8217;t have a smooth table, use a plastic tablecloth first.  </p>
<p>6.  Draw on the computer &#8211; there are lots of different programs you can use depending on the age of your kids.  Children love to see their work printed out. </p>
<p>7.  Draw with rocks &#8211; when my sister and I were girls, Mum encouraged us to find art materials in the world around us.  We loved collecting rocks and testing out which ones could be used to draw on the concrete.  We soon learnt that &#8220;soft&#8221; rocks were good for drawing, but &#8220;hard ones&#8221; didn&#8217;t yield much colour.  </p>
<p>8.  Draw on your back &#8211; most toddlers like having their back tickled.  See if your child can guess simple shapes you draw on their back with your finger.  Let them have a go drawing on your back!</p>
<p>9.  Draw with candles &#8211; the wax will seem &#8220;invisible&#8221; on the page.  Wash watercolour paints over the page to reveal the drawing!  A great one for mixed ages of kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">10. Draw with different grade lead pencils &#8211; try giving your kids a HB,  4B and 8B lead pencil to try.  The soft, dark leads are lovely to draw with.  Older kids might like to draw houses and buildings, or even a new floor plan for their bedroom! </p>
<p style="text-align: center">________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">You never know what impact these fun, early experiences will have on your child.  My little sister turned drawing into a career and is now a successful <a href="http://yourarchitect.com.au/">architect</a>!  Do you have another idea to add?  Leave a comment here! </p>
