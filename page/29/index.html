<p>There are many, many Christmas carols that tell the story of Jesus&#8217; birth, so we often sing as we play.  This is a very natural way for children to learn, and an excellent way of reinforcing the story.  You don&#8217;t have to be a brilliant vocalist &#8211; just have a go!  If you&#8217;re really not confident though stick a CD on in the background.</p>
<p>My daughter&#8217;s favourite song to sing with the felt board is Colin Buchanan&#8217;s &#8220;On That Very First Christmas&#8221; (from the album <em>King of Christmas</em> which you can <a href="https://secure.colinbuchanan.com.au/shop/shop92.html">purchase here</a> for $19.95 or at any Christian bookstore).  It&#8217;s an upbeat, toddler-friendly song with lots of repetition and an easy tune.</p>
<p><em>Mary and Joseph go to Bethlehem, Bethlehem, Bethlehem,</em></p>
<p><em>Mary and Joseph go to Bethlehem, On that very first Christmas.</em></p>
<p><em>Baby Jesus born that night, born that night, born that night,</em></p>
<p><em>Baby Jesus born that night, on that very first Christmas.</em></p>
<p><em>Wise men come to worship him&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>Shepherds told that the king is born&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>Angels singing glory to God&#8230;<br />
</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Have carols started on high rotation in your house yet?  What songs do your kids know that tell the story of the first Christmas?</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think it&#8217;s so important that we choose appropriate books for our kids.  Appropriate in terms of content, length, language and more.  But I also believe it&#8217;s important to stretch our kids a little.  It&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of only buying and borrowing &#8220;toddler&#8221; books right up until formal schooling starts!  Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; I&#8217;m not saying we should read novels to young children.  Eek!  But I am saying that we need to make sure our kids are increasingly exposed to stories with quality sentence structure and broader vocabulary as they grow.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to go with an area of interest for your child.  As they get older they will do this naturally.  Regular SquiggleMum readers will know that I&#8217;m a bird nerd, and my kids are too.  So this week my three year old borrowed two wonderful picturebooks from the library about birds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2082" title="bird_books" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/bird_books-300x225.jpg" alt="bird_books" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Birds Build Nests</em> (written by Yvonne Winer and illustrated by Tony Oliver)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>King of the Birds</em> (written and illustrated by Helen Ward)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both contain language which is a bit more of a stretch for my daughter, but she has just loved them.  <em>Birds Build Nests</em> is written in verse, with each stanza describing a different type of nest.  In this book she has come across words such as tranquil, rookeries, abandoned, silhouetted, etched, fledgelings, tailors, intricate, russett, delicate, craggy, predators, secure, camouflaged, tundra and more!  These aren&#8217;t words a toddler typically encounters, but my daughter coped with them because they are well supported by the illustrations, and they relate to an area of personal interest to her.  In our (several) readings of this book we have talked about many of these new words, though I did not stop and explain each new word to her as we read unless she particularly asked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083" title="birdnest_coll" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/birdnest_coll.jpg" alt="birdnest_coll" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>King of the Birds</em> is a retelling of an old folktale which we have read over, and over again.  It reads beautifully, and while some words have been new again for my daughter she has understood remarkably well.  Because the topic is of special interest to her she has coped with sentences like: &#8220;<em>The struggling broad-bellied birds, the fluttering finches and sparrows, the lazy flap of gulls and slim-winged sea crossers, the busy wings of auks and the invisible beats of hummingbirds all rose higher&#8230; and higher, a column of birds circling up to the sky.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2084" title="birdking_coll" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/birdking_coll.jpg" alt="birdking_coll" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p>And on top of all this rich language, both books include identification guides at the end of the text.  My daughter and I have pored over these pages &#8211; looking up names of birds unfamiliar to us, comparing eggs, finding Australian birds and learning about habits of different species.  Of course I have not read these pages in their entirety to my daughter &#8211; she&#8217;s only 3!  But they have prompted wonderful conversations and I have been able to pick out facts to share with her.</p>
<p>What piques your child&#8217;s interest?  Is it insects?  Trucks?  Space?  Dinosaurs?  Dolphins?  Use their interest area as an opportunity to take them further with language.  And yes, that might mean you need to learn a thing or two about velociraptors or black holes or ornithology&#8230;</p>
<p>Happy reading!!</p>

		<p>Nothing acknowledges that you are embracing Christmas quite like a wreath on the front door.  It says, &#8220;We&#8217;re happy it&#8217;s Christmas and we&#8217;re happy you&#8217;re here too!&#8221;  Have you got one on your door yet?  If not, here are three super easy wreaths you can make with your toddler, all using paper plates as an inexpensive base.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2062" title="wreath_coll" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/wreath_coll.jpg" alt="wreath_coll" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p>For each of the wreaths, start with a plain paper plate.  Cut into the centre of the plate and remove the inner circle.  How much of each wreath your child will be able to do independently will vary.  As a <strong>rough</strong> guide though:</p>
<ul>
<li>One year olds+ can stick paper onto blobs of glue.</li>
<li>Two year olds+ can spread glue and stick on precut paper.</li>
<li>Three year olds+ can do some cutting, glue independently and have their own ideas on how to approach tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might like to have a go at one of these easy wreaths&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  Hand wreath.  Trace around your child&#8217;s hand onto Christmas wrapping paper, or coloured paper.  Fold the paper over so that you can cut out several at the same time.  Paste the hands onto the wreath overlapping slightly.  Attach hanging ribbon.  Alternatively you could paint little hands and do lovely handprints, then cut out when dry &#8211; if you don&#8217;t mind mess!  (These three hand wreaths were made by toddlers aged 14mths, 18mths and 3 &#8211; with varying degrees of adult support.)</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2063" title="wreaths_1" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/wreaths_1-225x300.jpg" alt="wreaths_1" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>2.  Leaf wreath.  Inspired by <a href="http://salisburydowns.wordpress.com/2009/11/19/were-going-on-a-leaf-hunt/">Caro&#8217;s leaf hunt</a> we searched the backyard for interesting leaves and collected a fantastic array of green, yellow, red and purple leaves.  Using PVA glue we attached these to our paper plate ring.  To add some Christmas sparkle we also glued on sequins and attached some jingly bells.  This wreath turned out so well and is currently on our front door!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2064" title="wreaths_2" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/wreaths_2-225x300.jpg" alt="wreaths_2" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>3.  Ribbon wrapped wreath.  This was one probably the most challenging for us.  It was definitely a team effort as I helped my three year old to wind the ribbons round and around, through the centre of the ring, without getting tangled up!  She got frustrated at times, but we persisted and she got the hang of it.  We used ribbon scraps from our giftwrapping box, and secured them at the back of the paper plate ring with sticky tape.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2065" title="wreaths_3" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/wreaths_3-225x300.jpg" alt="wreaths_3" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>Do you have any other suggestions for wreaths toddlers can make?  Leave a comment below, or blog your ideas and I&#8217;ll link you up here!</p>

		<p>I was a fan of <a href="http://www.thetoybug.com.au">The Toy Bug</a> before I got to meet Jo Debnam in real life.  I love the wide range of good quality toys, high percentage of wooden items and lack of cartoony characters.  Now that I have a three year old and one year old I&#8217;m finding Christmas present shopping a little harder to manage in the stores, especially without my daughter seeing what I&#8217;m purchasing!  Online shopping is the way to go.  Even better &#8211; Jo has kindly offered SquiggleMum readers a <strong>10% discount</strong> off any Toy Bug toys!  <strong>(Use the code SM10 for your discount.)</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s so tempting to overspend on our kids at Christmas, so here are my budget conscious picks from <a href="http://www.thetoybug.com.au">The Toy Bug</a>.  And don&#8217;t forget you get to take an extra 10% off.  Happy Shopping!!</p>

<p><em>One day my children won’t be children any more. They’ll be grownups. They’ll probably have children of their own. And every Christmas they’ll look back on their childhood. More than any gift I ever buy them, I want them to remember Christmas lullabies. More than the food I prepare, I want them to remember the way we decorated the tree. I so badly want them to remember quiet Christmas Eves more than a cranky, flustered Mummy with a to-do list longer than a stocking. And I don’t mind whether they carry on my traditions, or make their own (someone please remind me about this in 2029) as long as their focus is on their family.</em></p>

		<p>A friend of ours has a game my daughter never tires of: a marble run.  It&#8217;s the first thing she asks for whenever we visit.  She loves putting the pieces together, dropping the marbles into the hole at the top and watching them make their way down through the tubes.</p>
<p>This week in the backyard we seemed to have an abundance of bark, so I suggested we make our own marble run using macadamia nuts.  I showed Little Miss 3 how the nut would roll down if she propped one end of the bark against a tree, and that was all the encouragement she needed.  She found extra bark to add at the bottom to keep the nut rolling.  There was a lot of trial and error, and occasional moments of frustration, but overall we had a fun time outdoors playing (and learning).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2019" title="marble_nature_coll" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/marble_nature_coll.jpg" alt="marble_nature_coll" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p>Many commercial games today have their roots in the great outdoors.  Some games have exceptionally long histories, with evidence dating back thousands of years.  Children (and adults) played games long before the development of checkers, or chess pieces, or monopoly counters or marbles.  Before there was cardboard, boardgames were simply scratched out in the dirt.  And nature provides plenty of &#8220;counters&#8221; in the form of pebbles, nuts, berries and more.</p>
<p>An easy game to try in the backyard is noughts and crosses.  Scratch the grid out in the dirt, but use rocks and leaves (or whatever&#8217;s around) as counters and try to get three in a row.  If you have older kids you might like to have a go at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mancala">mancala</a> style games using holes in the dirt and small stones.</p>
<p>Do you have any other suggestions for outdoor boardgames?</p>

		<p>Complete toilet training is a longer process than I thought.  I&#8217;m sharing my thoughts on the whole process over at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/404-advanced-toilet-training">Parenting Australia</a> today.  Head over there to read the rest of this post, and find out what&#8217;s involved in, ahem, ATT.</p>
<p><em>Before I had my own children, I thought toilet training was a period of a few weeks whereby a child transitioned from wearing nappies to wearing pants. Sure there would be accidents, and a few incentives might be required, but once it was done it was done. Over. Finished. Good bye nappy, hello happy pants. </em></p>
<p><em>Wrong. </em></p>
<p><em>We generally say a child is “toilet trained” when they can recognise the need to go, and get there in time to do it. But there is still a lot more to the toilet training process.  I am learning that it takes a couple of years (yes, YEARS) for the process to be done.  Beyond the basics of get-there-and-go comes what I’m calling Advanced Toilet Training. Yep, made that one up all by myself.  ATT for short.</em></p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>On the weekend my kids and I went to a wild rumpus in the park hosted by <a href="http://www.cradlefables.com/">Cradle Fables</a>.  We roared our terrible roars and gnashed our terrible teeth and rolled our terrible eyes and showed our terrible claws.</p>
<p>The wild rumpus was of course inspired by Maurice Sendak&#8217;s classic picture book <em>Where The Wild Things Are</em>.  The story which has enchanted generations of children is about to be released as a feature film, sparking renewed interest in the tale.  I remember having this story read to me as a child, I have studied it with students and now have the privilege of sharing it with my own children.  Here are my little wild things listening to the story at the rumpus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1971" title="wild_things2" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wild_things2.jpg" alt="wild_things2" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p>While the book appears simple, containing in fact only ten sentences, it is actually a very deep story.  Here are my thoughts on how you can help your little ones to get the most out of this remarkable picture book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read it slowly.  I usually find I need to read this story more slowly than some other books, partly to give my child time to process and partly because many sentences run over several pages.</li>
<li>Read it emotively.  Toddlers need your emotion behind the words to help them understand the context.</li>
<li>Read it dramatically.  There are lots of opportunities to interact with the book.  Roll your eyes, gnash your teeth, stare your toddler down, use your face to show what loneliness feels like.  Boys especially need this physical interaction with the text.</li>
<li>Understand the subtext.  This is actually a book about anger.  Mum sends Max to his room for stirring up trouble, and while in time out he processes his frustrations through imaginative role play.  The resolution comes in his understanding and acceptance of his mother&#8217;s loving discipline.  Obviously that&#8217;s an adult explanation of the text and not one you would share with a child (!!) but understanding the subtext may help you to connect the book to your own child&#8217;s experiences.  Have they been sent to time out?  When they are angry does their face look like Max&#8217;s?  Do they know that someone loves them best of all, even when they mess up?</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry too much.  Some parents are concerned about the scariness of the story, and worry that their child may not sleep well.  I have shared this book with many, many children and my experience has always been positive.  Even though the wild things are a little scary looking, Max is always in control and readers usually identify with Max.</li>
<li>Leave your child questioning!  Most children will be quick to realise that Max has been imagining &#8211; or has he?  Check out the moon at the start and the end of the book&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy reading!!  ROOAARRRRRR!</p>
