		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s amazing just how strong people become when faced with life changing challenges. For some people their time has come and the mountain proves to steep. No matter how many loved ones are there to help the assent it&#039;s sometimes not enough. Others fight and come out on top but it is never easy and they are left with a permanent emotional reminder. We all know someone effected by illness either side of the mountain. It&#039;s beautiful that some climbers have the strength to share their story...

		<description><![CDATA[What an inspiring woman!

I really agree with the notion of synchronicity and it brings to mind a quote I read as a child; &#039;A coincidence is just a miracle where God chose to remain anonymous&#039;. I really like that notion.

Thanks SquiggleMum for sharing this and I look forward to joining you on the 16th with my brush and tin or red paint!

Claudy

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for raising awareness of this Cath. So important. It is the kind of thing you think will never happen to you - but it does. My younger brother has recently finished finished three rounds of treatment for Hodgkin&#039;s Lymphoma (and has been cleared, praise God!) He was diagnosed at age 27 and we have no family history of cancer. It was awful to see him go through it all. He is blessed with an amazing wife who supported him wonderfully. I can&#039;t imagine someone going through it while trying to care for young children.
