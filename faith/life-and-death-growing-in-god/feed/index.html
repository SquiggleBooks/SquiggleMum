		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post. It so often seems to me that the children are closer to understanding death and its implications than we are! After 37+ years on this earth I still can&#039;t completely wrap my mind around the circle/cycle of life and death, so it is so helpful to know what other moms and children are talking about, and so powerful to read your corresponding stories about God/Nature. The creation so clearly reflects the Creator, and yet still brings us back to our ever present questions. The questions are always so much more prescient than answers could ever be. It takes the children to remind us of this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great answers to those tricky questions Cath.  I think it&#039;s good to be upfront with kids- tell them  what&#039;s happened and why.  It&#039;s amazing what they can understand and cope with.  Our neighbour passed away at the end of last year and we too had to answer a lot of questions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post. It&#039;s always hard choosing to face these questions with honesty and in an age appropriate way. I really wanted to find a great Easter book to share with our kids. One that captured the message of hope. But I didn&#039;t find anything. Do you know of any?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this Cath. We avoided telling the kids before we left for the funeral, as we believe it would have made the kids anxious that something might happen to us while we were away. Then when we got home we have just avoided the topic... and it just hasn&#039;t come up again. Although Mr 5 DID ask &quot;why are you so sad and grumpy mummy?&quot; - I should have just gone for it then! But when it comes up again, we need to tell him why his friend&#039;s mummy isn&#039;t around next time we visit the family... I will be sure to remember your short and sweet answers xx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think your answers are honest and truthful - and that&#039;s what kids really need. I naturally want to shield them from pain (my kids) but it&#039;s simply not realistic to do that.  They need to learn and accept and move on - just like we do :)]]></description>
