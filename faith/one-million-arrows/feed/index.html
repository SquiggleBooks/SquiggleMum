		<description><![CDATA[Had lunch with a friend today who encouraged me that even though *I* think the kids have not caught our faith, we don&#039;t know what&#039;s going on in their hearts. She thought it was a HUGE thing that my 16 year old son asked me to pray for him the other day when he was facing an exam ...it made me feel MUCH better than when I wrote my previous comment!

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting review of an interesting book - I read the first chapter too. Have to admit, with a 16 y.o. and a 13 y.o., sadly it feels too late. Feel a bit of a sense of failure as neither of my kids is really running red hot for Jesus, but don&#039;t know how I could have raised them any differently. V. aware of my faults and failings esp as a parent, but at the same time have tried to show them that we have an awesome God who redeems those faults and failings. I take comfort in the thought that &quot;train up a child&quot; verse, and I know God will never let them go. I just want so much MORE for them!!!!! It is sad to see them taking things for granted because they were raised in a Christian home :-(

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the link. I had heard about the book but didn&#039;t realise you could download a chapter.
I&#039;m really interested in reading it - love the phrase &quot;Will the world change our children…or will our children change the world?&quot;
