		<description><![CDATA[It really does sound like a wonderful job......and I know you will be fantastic.

I am dying to know what God has planned for me. At the moment life is going in a very opposite direction to what I had planned. I feel like my life and return-to-work plans are in turmoil. The way it is looking my family leave will be over before I even conceive my second child.

This post was nice to read. Nice to know that things come together.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I found that verse in the bible the Dad before my Dad passed away (way back when I was 19) it had a huge impact on my life - knowing He had plans and this, as hard as it was, was part of it.  It&#039;s precious to have something you can trust in.  Goodluck with the new job - it&#039;s sounds so fabulous!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is one of my favourite bible verses and one I often come back to. Like you I often make my own plans but it always works out better when I &#039;let go and let God&#039;. Thanks for the reminder!]]></description>

God&#039;s ways are always higher than ours, and He always has bigger and better plans for us. I look forward to seeing how His plan unfolds for you.]]></description>
