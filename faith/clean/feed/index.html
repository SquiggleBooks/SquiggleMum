		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your encouragement Hayley!  My little man will be 4 months on the weekend so our bubs are similar ages.  I&#039;m starting to feel more human again now that he&#039;s sleeping through the night.  Hope you are getting some sleep too, and taking care of yourself.  Being a mum is hard work!]]></description>
