		<description><![CDATA[My favourite analogy of all Catherine! It really is a case of seeing the things God begins to do in our lives when we choose to put our faith in Him.  What a special conversation to have with LM3.  Hope there are many more like it to come.

PS  I had to giggle at the grass growing question.  A very inquisitive mind working!

		<description><![CDATA[Nicely done.
We are in the &quot;why&quot; questions stage which I have waited a long time for and yet find myself a bit frustrated by. Then there are the &quot;How do you...&quot; questions which are better than when the child takes matters into her own hands. The other day she decided she wanted an orange shirt so she took off her white tank top and began coloring it with an orange marker. She was quite into her little project before I found her. When I understood her purpose I explained that wasn&#039;t the way to get an orange shirt, so of course she asked how to do it. I could have (I suppose) just bought her an orange shirt, but instead we went to the craft store and bought some orange dye...and I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll be blogging about that little project soon...

		<description><![CDATA[Whether one believes in God or not, that was a lovely lovely way of defining your faith Cath. well done. xx

Grace asked me this evening how the third person on earth was this evening.  Biblically i had no idea and you try explaining that it was probably some ape-like creature crawling around the jungle hunting for nuts and bananas :) x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My 4-year-old son is into make believe big time at the moment and it&#039;s so much fun. Today he went from being Sam, to being &quot;Samba&quot;, a little boy with a pet caterpillar by the name of Sanda, to Steve Irwin catching crocodiles in the toy room. I have always been very clear with him about the difference between real and make believe as I don&#039;t want him to ever think that God or the Bible stories aren&#039;t real. I think our kids are going to have a harder time separating truth and fiction than we did due to the amazing advances in technology. When we were growing up, a cartoon looked pretend. Now, the 3D animations make everything look very, very real. I am a great believer in teaching our kids critical literacy - learning to question and evaluate everything they see and read. Sam already watches the ads on TV and asks, &quot;Mummy, what are they trying to get me to buy with this one?&quot; And those moments make me very proud :)

		<description><![CDATA[See, that explanation would never have satified me as a child, I would have rolled my eyes at any adult who tried to explain that god was real. Like I do now ;) (I think I&#039;ve always been a skeptic, not just in my grown-up days!)
