		<description><![CDATA[I am so glad I read this blog post the other day.  Today on the way home from church I stopped with the kids to collect autumn leaves to use at school this week. We climbed back in to the car and discovered the youngest had dragged dog poo all over the seats.  So when we got home instead of getting lunch I cleaned the car. Went to get bread for lunch only to discover someone had not closed the lid on maple syrup bottle and it had been knocked over and spilt EVERYWHERE! Decided to wait till after lunch to lean up TNT and then realized there was no bread, luckily we did have some in freezer. Wanted to cry and scream but remembered this great song so I got out the iPad and while I enjoyed the lyrics the kids loved the video clip. Good reminder of how big I am blessed. Thank you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m smiling after listening to that song - thanks for the pick me up after a long day of &#039;not being together&#039;! I starting to expect that God will do the unexpected in my life - very little seems to pan out how I plan at the beginning of a day (or week or year!). So interesting to look back though and see how He&#039;s been at work...so glad I don&#039;t have to plan it all though!]]></description>
