		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this article. You have articulated exactly how I have felt over the last week. Today I made the decision to be a full time stay at home mum, for at least the next 12 months anyway. This week I have taken off my S vest and am happy to burn it! I just want to be me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hear ya. Still struggling with that one myself (not the Supermum part though!). I&#039;m not sure whether it&#039;s a personal standards thing or self-esteem or just trying to make sure that everyone else believes it. Accepting yourself as less than perfect is really hard when all through school you got marks for getting things right - no marks for wrong answers or mistakes! I guess that&#039;s where being a Christian is liberating - Christ works in our weakness to make us perfect in a different way - phew. By the way, the pic is lovely - I think it&#039;s totally super!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, you are good enough! God loves you as you are. It&#039;s hard to try to be super -in fact it&#039;s just not possible! Real life just gets in the way all the time - there are always curves in the road when we least expect them. I think that&#039;s why God gave us family and friends - to lean on when the curves get tight. Dont forget to call on God for help too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great post Cath - it&#039;s a hard to strive to be the best you can be, but also accept real life reality.  Lucky for me, I have a strong lazy streak that holds me back from overload!]]></description>
