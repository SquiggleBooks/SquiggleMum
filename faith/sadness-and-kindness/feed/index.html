		<description><![CDATA[Oh, you have made me cry too. So often I see people upset and am not sure what to do. It is different with friends, that hug or coffee comes easily. Thanks for your kindness to strangers, and putting it here to inspire others. I hope to try harder too, &#039;kindness is the best thing in the world&#039; (Enid Blyton)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Such a beautiful gesture - the world would be such a nicer place if we all stopped to think of others like you did. Here&#039;s hoping that the small act of buying the flowers sent some love in her general direction.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you.
That sad lady could well have been me.
Except I haven&#039;t made it out of the house today.
and I rarely talk on my phone.
and my kids won&#039;t eat sushi.

The kindness of strangers never ceases to amaze me.
Thank You.

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think it was me, I save my tears for home, but there were a few times when I&#039;ve cried in public and everyone pretended not to notice.

Thank you for noticing.  Next time, forget the flowers, just give me a hug...

Here I go, crying again....

		<description><![CDATA[Such a lovely thought and a lovely post. I also try to teach my children that our kindness and concern shouldn&#039;t be limited to those who are already in our family or circle of friends.

I know that I have been blessed by the kindness of strangers on occasions and hope that I am showing my children, as you are yours, that it is possible for one person to make a positive difference in the lives of others.

Bless you.
