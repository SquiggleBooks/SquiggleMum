		<description><![CDATA[And some days I want to quit. I want to find the woman responsible for the out rage going on in my house. The woman who can just come get her fit throwing 2 yr old and her too-cool-to-be-told-what-to-do 7 yr old. Cause I QUIT. But then I look around. And no one is coming. No one at all. Because I am the mother God gave to those children and He must have known what He was doing, right? :))) So I carry on. Asking Him for strength. Asking Him to love me on my imperfect mothering days and to help me love them on their imperfect kid days. Thank God I do not mother alone.

Thank you for your comment on my blog.]]></description>
