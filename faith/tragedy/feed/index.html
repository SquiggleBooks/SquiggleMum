		<description><![CDATA[Well said Cath. Most of our mourning and adoration is nothing but human hypocrisy. Granted, MJ was a great artist but how will he be remembered in the eyes of God? Is it in the years of his great artistic genius or the later years of tragedy and scandal? May God have mercy on his soul.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for writing this post, and for the love behind it.  I have tried to share this perspective myself and don&#039;t think I did it half as well as you.  As we share this post with our friends, may God be honoured as people reconsider serving others as an expression of our love for God &amp; His Word.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So beautifully said Cath. It is true, we are a world that has totally lost persepective on what is important and what is not. I guess with music being such a powerful medium to move people, and everyone having watched MJ grow up (and crash down) people the world over feel like they knew him somehow.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m so pleased to read this post.  I have been feeling so irritated with all the hoo-haw over the celebrity deaths for exactly these reasons.

I mean, it&#039;s sad.  Of course it&#039;s sad.  But it is not MORE sad than every other death.]]></description>
