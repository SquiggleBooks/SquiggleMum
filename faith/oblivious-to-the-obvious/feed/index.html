		<description><![CDATA[Hi, i am following the 31 blog challenge and found your post through that.

Your post reminded me of a talk from the &#039;technology, entertainment, design&#039; talks that you may or may not know about.

I think you will like the story as it is about a young girl like your daughter. Here is the link.

		<description><![CDATA[This is an insightful post. I too, always forgot to count the blessings. Sometimes we just need to stop and smell the roses, enjoy the breathtaking views of nature that God has given us. You ought to be proud of your kids, they are adorable, and they are so smart to make such a flawless point. Yes, God really did (and still doing) a good job, but we just tend to overlook it, always.

God bless, and happy anniversary.
