		<description><![CDATA[I wish I had invested in a nice nappy bag, instead I just made do with a big satchel handbag which was nice but not being purpose-made it was a bit of a hassle.

I also tend to carry around the baggage that other people share.  I also create too much baggage of my own by being overly sensitive to criticisms!

Thanks for sharing,

		<description><![CDATA[Hey Cath
My DGL elective at conference was all about The &quot;Baggage&quot; We Bring to a discussion group as leaders and mums
Ties in nicely with this post thanks. And love the non nappy-bag bag. Nice! I just dumped Gus&#039;s nappy bag and switched over to his own big boys backpack. He&#039;s still in nappies so we have all the usual nappy bag contents but no nappy bag for mummy to lug around....I got a nice new muummas bag instead) - definitely a milestone worth celebrating]]></description>
