		<description><![CDATA[I also have a few.  But have chosen one - Phil 4:4-7  Rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice!  Let your gentleness be evident to all.  The Lord is near.  Do not be anxious about anything but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.  And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds in christ Jesus.

And for the kids!  Ephesians 6:1  &quot;Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hmmm there are lots of great verses....which to choose????

Psalm 46:1
God is our refuge and strength,an ever-present help in trouble.

Keeping it real...:)
Proverbs 11:22
Like a gold ring in a pig&#039;s snout is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion.

Zephaniah 3:17
&quot;The LORD your God is with you,
       he is mighty to save.
       He will take great delight in you,
       he will quiet you with his love,
       he will rejoice over you with singing.&quot;

Romans 10:8-10
&quot;The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart,&quot; that is, the word of faith we are proclaiming: That if you confess with your mouth, &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[One of my favourite bible verses is 2 Sam 22:31-37, here&#039;s the first part of this:
As for God, his way is perfect;
the word of the Lord is flawless.
He is a shield to all who take refuge in him.
And who is God besides the Lord? And who is the Rock except our God?]]></description>
