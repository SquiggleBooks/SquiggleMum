		<description><![CDATA[I have only been following &#039;Squigglemum&#039; since conference but I love your outlook on life, faith, mothering.....
Your song &quot;Even there&quot; is so beautiful and on several occasions during the last week when I have faced a &#039;hurdle&#039; or difficult situation of some kind I have heard the words &quot;Even there&quot; repeating in my mind and known that God was absolutely with me 100%.  This might seem over the top but I would love to be able to download a podcast of your song.
Thanks]]></description>
