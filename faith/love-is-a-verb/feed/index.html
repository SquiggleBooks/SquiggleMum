		<description><![CDATA[When we moved to Wagga many years ago, we had a lovely lady do the same thing for us.  She made a hamper up of paper plates, plastic cutlery, orange juice, coffee and sugar, milk and a yummy chicken casserole.  We were so moved by this act of generosity.  It made our first day in a new town, something to remember instead of a horrid day not being able to find anything in the boxes.  It picked our spirits up no end.  Good on you Catherine.  I&#039;m very proud of you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;I also want to teach my kids about love.  I want them to know what it truly means to love people, and I want to show them that love is a verb.&quot;  Young kids learn so much from actions as opposed to just words.

I have been on the receiving end of such hospitality and  when returning it to others try to have the kids participate if possible, so they can really understand what it is all about.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Lovely thing to do! (That was your nice comment) :)

I agree with so much of this - it is the simple little things, done form the heart, that will mean so much to others.

PS - did you nibble out the heart of the bread that you gave her too? LOL!!!]]></description>
