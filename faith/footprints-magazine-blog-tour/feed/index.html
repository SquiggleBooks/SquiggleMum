		<description><![CDATA[The arrogant person ‘knows’ they are correct; ‘knows’ their opinions and views are the truth. They need no assistance from others; it is the other who needs assistance and direction from them.

Those to whom much has been given sometimes suffer from arrogance; or rather the people around them suffer.

Arrogance is doubly a pity, because the talents of the arrogant serve primarily themselves. The arrogant assumes their views and opinions are The Truth. In arrogance, natural confidence goes sadly awry.

For a ruling political leader to declare publicly, that whilst they greatly respect other people’s religious views, they do not believe in God – even though “I grew up in the Christian church, a Christian background. I won prizes for catechism, for being able to remember Bible verses. I am steeped in that tradition, but I’ve made decisions in my adult life about my own views”, seems terribly arrogant indeed.

Terribly arrogant and sad of Miss Gillard (Australia’s first female Prime Minister) to openly declare that she knows God – but she doesn’t need Him. But then again it begs asking if The Prime Minister personally KNOWS GOD or just ‘about’ Him’?

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t need a subscription either as I contribute to the mag and have about 11 subscriptions LOL  I just wanted to say great interview :)

I absolutely agree with you Janet about reading things in print.  I know Footprints does lots online but I really encourage you to continue printing too.  Sometimes I print things off the internet just so I can read it &quot;properly&quot; and have something to refer to time and time again.
