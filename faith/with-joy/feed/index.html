		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this post Cath. We sure can learn a lot from our little ones. We often joke that my youngest&#039;s attitude is &quot;hooray for everything!&quot; I love this about her and encourage  my kids to try and see the positive in every situation. I should do the same!]]></description>
