		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s so exciting to read about your passion for your writing and your prizes, Catherine. I&#039;m sure a contract is just around the corner. I think non-fiction is really taking it&#039;s place and when I attended Sydney SCWBI, one of the sessions was on the types of non-fiction books that are part of core curriculum in the US and there are some gorgeous ones. Congratulations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congrats Cath!!  We have surely read our fair share of boring non-fiction books (including non-fiction home readers for that matter) so I&#039;m pretty sure we have never read anything as amazing as your stories.  I really hope you land a contract soon!]]></description>
