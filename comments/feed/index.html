		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s lovely to see it from another perspective :)

Kindergarten is such a joyful time but I always feel a little mean taking these gorgeous ones &quot;away&quot; from their Mums.

I&#039;ve made it to now and am starting to tear up that they&#039;ve finished and are moving on from Kindy!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the tag Catherine. I certainly have a lot of WIP&#039;s to choose from, now to decide which lines 7-14 or page 7 or 77 I like best! 
I love your excerpt, it feels beautiful!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s so exciting to read about your passion for your writing and your prizes, Catherine. I&#039;m sure a contract is just around the corner. I think non-fiction is really taking it&#039;s place and when I attended Sydney SCWBI, one of the sessions was on the types of non-fiction books that are part of core curriculum in the US and there are some gorgeous ones. Congratulations.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Congrats Cath!!  We have surely read our fair share of boring non-fiction books (including non-fiction home readers for that matter) so I&#039;m pretty sure we have never read anything as amazing as your stories.  I really hope you land a contract soon!]]></description>
