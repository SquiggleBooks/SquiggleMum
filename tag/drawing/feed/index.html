				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An outdoor chalkboard is another project I have had on my to-do list for a while. I love the idea of children having lots of writing and drawing opportunities outdoors.  I often find that writing naturally flows outside without the pressure of a classroom environment or the constraints of A4 paper.  Chalk is inviting too, because of its non-permanent nature and its accessibility for little hands. (<em>In fact, Mr 2 drew his first &#8220;people&#8221; pictures on the chalk board! See bottom left picture.</em>)<span id="more-5569"></span></p>
<p>Since adding <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">basket storage to our fences</a>, I have seen the potential in using fences to enhance the playspace rather than merely marking the garden&#8217;s boundaries.  So, we attached the large blackboard directly to the fence!  I also made a couple of extra smaller blackboards which can be moved around and used as needed.  One is a menu board in the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>, the other is waiting for playful inspiration&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboards.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5570" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboards.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="454" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Purchasing large chalk boards can be expensive. Making them yourself isn&#8217;t!  We bought marine ply for our boards so that they would withstand the outdoor conditions.  The cost was less than $15.  We then gave the plywood two coats of chalkboard paint.  The paint was under $20 and we still have a LOT left over for future projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Oh, and an old teacher-tip for you: <strong>to make chalk drawings semi-permanent, soak the chalk in a strong solution of sugar and water before using</strong>.  I drew the leaves in a corner of the large board, and the word <em>Menu </em>on one of the smaller boards in sugar-soaked chalk.  The kids can rub over them, and they won&#8217;t rub off!  This trick lasts a long time inside, but a good soaking rain will still wash it away outside.  (We used to do this to draw the blue-and-white handwriting lines on the classroom blackboards to save ruling them up every day).</p>

<p style="text-align: center">What do you think? Anyone else want to try this easy project?</p>
