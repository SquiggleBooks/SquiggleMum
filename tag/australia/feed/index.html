				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spray bottles are a regular play item in our backyard during the warmer months, but with Autumn in the air it&#8217;s been a little too cool for this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_play.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5034" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_play.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">So instead I&#8217;ve been encouraging the kids to use the spray bottles differently. They&#8217;ve enjoyed using them to water in new plants, and lightly mist delicate fern leaves.  They&#8217;ve had fun squirting them high into the air.  Most of all, we&#8217;ve enjoyed creating water spray art together.  <span id="more-5012"></span>We didn&#8217;t set out to &#8220;do&#8221; this activity.  It just happened naturally out of playful exploration.  The first successful picture Miss 4 made was this one (below). I thought it was delightful and quickly snapped a pic:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_art.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5035" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_art.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Then we collected sticks and leaves, and talked about which items in the backyard would work well for water spray pictures.  We created this artwork together.  I took a photo of the natural set up first, then we sprayed our water bottles over the top, and removed the objects to reveal our art.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_how_to.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5036" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_how_to.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">All sorts of wonderful art followed, including this little masterpiece of a person.  It was created with rocks for the head and body, and leaves for arms and legs.  Miss 4 was so proud of herself when she finally achieved a recognisable person!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_person.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5037" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_person.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids don&#8217;t know it, of course, but this is actually very similar to a method used by indigenous Australians when painting on cave walls.  Instead of a spray bottle, the Aboriginal people mixed the ochre-and-water paint in their mouths, and spat it onto the rock.  Often they used their own hand as a stencil.
