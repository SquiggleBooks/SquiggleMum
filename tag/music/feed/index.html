		<description><![CDATA[Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have bamboo in our backyard that goes wild after good rain. Out of nowhere the spears shoot up, rising way past the top of our 6ft fence, before sprouting leaves. It provides great screening, but often needs serious pruning! The kids have used the  pruned <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/outdoor-multi-age-play/">bamboo spears in their play </a>in the past. Recently we tried something new.<span id="more-6265"></span></p>
<p>Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>To make our panflute we first stripped the bamboo of leaves and cut sections of bamboo, which the kids ordered according to length. We wrapped string around the first section, joining it to the second, then the third, and so on. This was a bit fiddly. We then wrapped string around all of the five sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, we wrapped in between each section. This helped to pull it all together tightly. We trimmed all of the ends and left them hanging at one side. Traditionally these were often plaited decoratively, or used to create a neck strap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As you can see from the photos, our panflute is fairly rudimentary! We could have sanded the cut sections of bamboo, we could have sealed the ends with wax, we could have used a crossbar&#8230; If you want to try a more authentic method, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-4-easy-Bamboo-Flutes-for-free/step4/Bamboo-Flute-Panflute/">instructables</a> have a 50+ step DIY guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>For us, the fun of this activity was in making something from nothing. We created a real musical instrument with string, secateurs, and a plant from the backyard. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6269" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">What could you and your kids create in the backyard together&#8230;?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Win tix to Justine Clarke's Pop Up Tour!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years as  blogger I have been able to work with some wonderful children&#8217;s authors and artists. One of my favourites is<a href="http://justineclarke.com.au"> Justine Clarke</a>, and I am always delighted to promote her music and concerts. <strong>This year I have TWO DOUBLE PASSES to her upcoming Pop Up Tour to give away to SquiggleMum readers. </strong>(Thanks Justine!)</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why I&#8217;m a fan:</p>
<p><span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/justine_clarke_brisconcert.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3731" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/justine_clarke_brisconcert.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>She&#8217;s Australian</strong>. Sure, there are wonderful artists overseas as well &#8211; but I appreciate the Aussie accent and Aussie content in her work. When my kids sing along, they aren&#8217;t singing about zeeeebras or wellies <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
<li><strong>She writes great songs!</strong>  I have heard so many other mums say that if they HAVE to have kids music playing in the car, they would rather it be Justine Clarke than anyone else. I have previously shared some thoughts about her music <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/top-songs-by-justine-clarke/">here</a> and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/top-songs-by-justine-clarke/">here</a> and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-interview-dvd-giveaway/">here</a>.  Oh, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-great-big-giveaway/">here</a>. Her music isn&#8217;t dumbed down for kids. It&#8217;s sophisticated musically while still being age appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>She performs &#8220;real&#8221; concerts</strong>. I enjoy seeing a real artist performing with real musicians, and I think kids do too.  Her setup is never OTT, and it doesn&#8217;t need to be because the music speaks for itself.  A live gig is a new experience for most kids.</li>
<li><strong>She cares about her little fans</strong>. She might walk the red carpet and receive nominations for acting awards, but she is never too busy for her little fans.  I&#8217;ve seen her stick around for a long time after shows to meet little ones, pose for endless photos, and accept lovingly drawn pictures of The Gumtree Family.</li>
<li><strong>She&#8217;s a mum</strong>. Just like us, she juggles her dreams with raising her kids.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/justine-popup-tour.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6125" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/justine-popup-tour.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="250" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Would you and your child like to go to Justine&#8217;s Pop Up Tour? Just leave a comment sharing what you like about Justine Clarke!</strong> One entry per person please, Aussie residents only, two winners will be drawn at random Sunday 29/7/12 8pm Qld time.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I look like I&#8217;ve got life sorted.</p>
<p>But the truth is, most of the time, I&#8217;m not so together.<span id="more-6064"></span></p>
<p>The kids aren&#8217;t always happy. The bickies aren&#8217;t always home-baked. The floors aren&#8217;t always swept.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s highly likely I can&#8217;t find my keys, or my phone, or my shoes, or my brain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know that God doesn&#8217;t need me to be perfect.</p>
<p>In fact &#8211; He often uses my weaknesses more than my strengths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>This song by Christian artist and young mum <a href="http://www.francescamusic.com/">Francesca Battistelli</a> always puts a smile on my face and reminds me to get some perspective. After all, it&#8217;s not the end of the world!  </em></strong></p>

		<description><![CDATA[So what is it exactly that makes this show stand out, and attract such a wave of support from parents and children?  Here are 8 (hehehe...) reasons why Octonauts are awesome.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To say the <em><strong>Octonauts</strong></em> have captured my kids&#8217; imaginations is an understatement, and I don&#8217;t think my children are alone!  I&#8217;ve overheard mums talking about the program, and kids role playing their favourite characters.  The Octonauts follows a team of adventure heroes who dive into action whenever there is trouble under the sea.  In  a fleet of aquatic vehicles they rescue amazing sea creatures, explore  incredible new underwater worlds and often save the day before returning  safely to their home base, the Octopod.<span id="more-5581"></span></p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L57l19PWuI&#038;feature=related</p>
<p>So what is it exactly that makes this show stand out, and attract such a  wave of support from parents and children?  Here are 8 (hehehe&#8230;)  reasons why <em><strong>Octonauts </strong></em>are awesome:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong>.  This program is a visual feast.  The talented duo from <a href="http://www.meomi.com/">Meomi </a>create a stunning CGI underwater world which combines true aspects of aquatic life with imaginary elements.</li>
<li><strong>Soundtrack</strong>.  Composer Darren Hendley (who also wrote the music for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/children/olivia/">Olivia</a>) brings to the program a high quality score reminiscent of any sci-fi-action-adventure film.  The music isn&#8217;t limited to opening and closing credits either. It features throughout each ten minute episode, adding to the excitement.</li>
<li><strong>Non-fiction content</strong>.  Each episode features an underwater animal in its natural habitat.  Along with the Octonauts, kids learn about interesting behaviours or unusual characteristics of each animal.</li>
<li><strong>Tried and true formula. </strong>Anyone who has watched their share of sci-fi adventures will recognise the similarities between the Octonauts and the crew from the Enterprise, or SG1, or&#8230;.  (Yes, I am married to a <a href="http://distractable.net">geek</a>).  Strong leader + shy medic + scientist-with-a-Scottish-accent + fearless adventurer = awesome team!</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent entertainment</strong>. Children&#8217;s programs which are &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; make me groan.  I believe television shows for kids should be language-rich, introduce interesting vocabulary, and model excellent use of conversation.  Octonauts more than meets my criteria in this department.</li>
<li><strong>Target age. </strong>There often seems to be a lack of good quality entertainment appropriate for kids in the 4-7 age range.  Between toddlers and tweenagers is a whole stage (which seems to be disappearing) called childhood!!  This program is ideal for lower primary aged kids. Yay!</li>
<li><strong>Environmental awareness</strong>.  I&#8217;m always happy for my kids to watch a television program which encourages them to get back outside after it&#8217;s finished, exploring the natural world and the creatures in it.  The &#8220;<em>Explore! Rescue! Protect!</em>&#8221; tagline of the Octonauts is relevant in any habitat.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>.  This program isn&#8217;t about good-guys and bad-guys.  It&#8217;s about good-guys and misunderstood-guys.  This is particularly important in the context of real animals.  There are no evil animals.  Sometimes creatures can harm us, but it is not because they are &#8220;bad&#8221; in any way.  Usually when animals hurt us it is because they are afraid and are defending themselves or their young.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_rainbow_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5427" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_rainbow_collage.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>My kids are huge fans of Justine Clarke, and I am a big supporter of her work as an Australian children&#8217;s entertainer.  I&#8217;ve met her <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/justine-clarke-in-concert/">backstage</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-interview-dvd-giveaway/">interviewed </a>her, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-great-big-giveaway/">reviewed and given away</a> her albums and dvds&#8230; <strong>and now I am delighted to be able to give away tickets to her <em>Little Day Out</em> Tour!</strong> I have TWO double-passes for a couple of lucky SquiggleMum readers.<span id="more-5420"></span></p>
<p>In order to win a pair of tickets, simply share your favourite Justine song!  Do <span style="text-decoration: line-through">you</span> your kids have a favourite?  I couldn&#8217;t pick between my top 3 songs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_colours.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5428" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_colours-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" /></a>Mrs Knife and Mr Fork</em> &#8211; One of my early faves.  For a children&#8217;s  song, the lyrics are just sublime.  Justine rocks a fifties vibe in the  film clip, and there&#8217;s lots of cool percussion played on cutlery.</li>
<li><em>Song to Make You Smile</em> &#8211; This song really does make me smile, and I sing it to the kids to make them smile too.  It has such a sweet melodic introduction, with a catchy chorus and positive message.</li>
<li><em>My Shadow and Me</em> &#8211; I loved this jazz number the first time I heard it, and I never tire of it.  Justine and her team really do set the standard when it comes to creating musically sophisticated, yet age appropriate for our kids.</li>

<p><strong>Giggle and Hoot</strong> continue to go from strength to strength as the lovable co-hosts of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/abcforkids/">ABC4Kids</a>.  I&#8217;ve had the opportunity both to <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/giggle-and-squiggle-giveaway/">interview Jimmy Giggle</a> (James Rees) and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/dear-jimmy-giggle/">meet him backstage</a>.  He really does deserve the attention he receives from kids across the country.  Late last year I watched him give the same genuine grin and hug to the 367th child waiting in line as he did for the first child in line.  He obviously loves what he does.</p>
<p>The latest offering from <strong>Giggle and Hoot</strong> is a DVD compilation of giggle-icious music.  Sing-along to new Giggle and Hoot   songs and enjoy well known tunes like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DitAAtfHYp8">Hoot&#8217;s Lullaby</a>.  On the DVD, <strong>Giggle and Hoot</strong> also present episodes or songs from some of my ABC favourites.  There&#8217;s a fantastic <strong>Playschool</strong> episode on Making Music, a <strong>Wiggle and Learn</strong> episode called &#8216;Beach, Beach, Sandy Beach,&#8217; songs from <strong>Justine Clarke</strong>, The <strong>Wiggles </strong>and more!  It&#8217;s a great compilation DVD for weekends, school holidays or rainy afternoons with toddlers!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do your children like to dance? Mine do.  This morning we twirled and whirled in tutus together &#8211; yes, I put one on too.  My daughter asked for &#8220;dancing music&#8221; so I flicked through the CD collection until I settled on one.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/ukulele-baby-wiggle-squiggle-giveaway/">The Wiggles</a>, even though Dorothy rather considers herself a dino-ballerina.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/justine-clarke-in-concert/">Justine Clarke</a>, even though she&#8217;s hands down my favourite children&#8217;s entertainer.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose a Playschool album, or a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/dear-jimmy-giggle/">Jimmy Giggle</a> album, or any other children&#8217;s album.</p>
<p>So what DID I choose?<span id="more-5088"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5090" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing4.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><em>Haydn, Rimsky-Korsakov, Schubert, Tchaikovsky </em>and <em>Grieg</em>.  Yes, classical orchestral music by some of the world&#8217;s best composers.  Despite my love for good qualitychildren&#8217;s music, I fear that at times we do our kids a disservice by not exposing them to music beyond this.  It is valuable for little ears to hear different sounds from different places and different times.  Rock music, classical music, folk music, jazz music, choral music and more.  (Of course there is much adult music that is inappropriate for children so you may need to check any lyrics before you push play!)</p>
<p>I spent many hours rehearsing and playing in orchestras myself as a child and as a teenager, and I still enjoy cranking up the volume of a great piece every now and then.  I can&#8217;t expect my kids to enjoy classical, or jazz (which I also love) with me if I never give them the opportunity to listen to it.  Or dance to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5091" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing_collage.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="304" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Which genres of music do you enjoy, </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>and do your kids listen, sing or dance along too?</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ukulele_baby.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4863" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ukulele_baby.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="295" /></a></p>
<p>The ukulele is such a fun instrument.  Its small size makes it ideal for young kids to handle, they are inexpensive (usually around $25) and come in a range of colours.  Of course, the ukulele is more than just a &#8220;toy guitar&#8221; as it is also a serious instrument in its own right.</p>
<p><em><strong><span id="more-4857"></span>Ukulele Baby!</strong></em> is the latest offering from Aussie children&#8217;s superstars The Wiggles, and explores the sound of the ukulele and the feel of music from the caribbean.  The Wiggles have set sail on a  new adventure with the sweet sound of strumming and palm trees in the  distance. Set on an island near Wiggle Bay, The Wiggles have launched  twenty three new songs including soon-to-be-classics like <em>You Can Play the Ukulele</em> and <em>Hula, Hula Baby</em>. The album also features a couple of special guests. The highlight for me is the hilarious revival of a 70&#8217;s kids song, <em>The Good Ship Fabulous Flea! </em>with Rolf Harris.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to my wiggly friends at Roadshow I have FOUR copies of <em>Ukulele Baby!</em> to give away to SquiggleMum readers. To enter, leave a comment sharing who your favourite Wiggle (or Wiggles character) is.</strong> Aussie residents only please. One entry per person. Comp closes Sunday 6/3/11 6pm Qld time.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The latest release from Hi-5 has hit the shelves for January, and thanks to my friends at Roadshow I have THREE copies to give away to SquiggleMum readers. </strong>The album is full of boppy songs, bright colours, great costumes and lots of dancing.  The title track, <em>Happy House</em> makes for a catchy opening, and my kids have been singing this one around the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4ag3IZ9dLE&#038;feature=related</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">My favourite track though is <em>Backyard Adventurers</em>. We do a fair bit of backyard adventuring here at our house!  I appreciate songs that encourage kids to get outside. It would be great to see this with footage of kids (or the Hi-5 Team) actually in a backyard and out of the studio!  I&#8217;m still not fussed on a lot of the dialogue. I&#8217;d love to see the Hi-5 team move to more natural sounding language, and speak &#8220;to&#8221; the children rather than &#8220;at&#8221; them.  Still, the album is enjoyable, and my own kids have had fun singing and dancing along with the colourful gang.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">The Squiggle Report:</h2>
<p><strong>Like </strong>- <em>Happy House</em>, <em>Backyard Adventurers</em>, the girls&#8217; shoes!!</p>
<p><strong>Dislike </strong>- dialogue patronising at times</p>
<p><strong>SquiggleKids rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<p><strong>SquiggleMum rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2>WIN a copy</h2>
<p>To win a copy of Hi-5&#8217;s latest release <strong>leave a comment below sharing what makes your home a <em>happy house</em></strong>!  Aussie residents only please. One entry per person.  Comp closes 6pm Qld time Sunday 30/1/11 and winners will be drawn at random.</p>
