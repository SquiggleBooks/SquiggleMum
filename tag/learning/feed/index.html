				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/identifying-birds-eggs/">keen birdwatcher</a>, Miss 5 knows the scientific names of a few of her favourite species.  The first one she learned was <em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em> &#8211; the scientific name for a Rainbow Lorikeet.  The second was the closely related <em>Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus</em>, or Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.  From this early introduction to scientific names, my daughter discovered that:<span id="more-6001"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>all living things have a common name and scientific name</li>
<li>every different type of living thing has its own special scientific name</li>
<li>scientific names have two words (usually)</li>
<li>scientific names have funny words that sound different to every-day words</li>
<li>animals that are similar might have similar names (eg: first word the same, second word different)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this week, when we discovered an unusual species of fungi in the yard, I asked the kids this question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were the first scientist to discover this amazing species, what would you call it?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I know &#8211; weird, right?!  We discussed its unusual shape, vibrant colour, pungent smell, and &#8220;tentacles&#8221; while thinking of a name.  Miss 5 said the first word should be <em>Fungus </em>(based on her understanding of scientific names).  Maybe <em>Fungus Octopus</em>? What about<em> Fungus Redstar </em>or<em> Fungus Crazy?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em></em>And then&#8230; the game was on!  Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for other fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are the, ahem, un-scientific names of species as decided by the SquiggleKids:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Orangey</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6004" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Rosy </em>(named and written by Mr 3)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Goldiae</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Umbrellus</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids ran with this activity because it was of interest to them.  (Not all kids would find fungi so fascinating!)  Even my three year old wanted to &#8220;write&#8221; his own sign, and I loved seeing his purposeful scribble.  This kind of scribble is early writing at its finest.  I especially liked my daughter&#8217;s <em>Fungus Umbrellus</em>.  We discussed how the word <em>umbrella</em> sounded like an everyday word, but <em>umbrellus</em> sounded like a &#8220;science&#8221; word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both kids were so proud of their efforts too, and couldn&#8217;t wait to show SquiggleDad their discoveries. I think I have a couple of young naturalists on my hands!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a cold afternoon, and after being outside all I could think about was wrapping my hands around a warm cup of tea.  I put the kettle on, and suggested the kids set up their own tea party for afternoon tea too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5288" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea3.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">They brought their &#8220;kids&#8221; along (a baby and a bear), then set the table with a tablecloth and our Plan Toys wooden tea set.  The three of us enjoyed the role play as we made tea, fed the &#8220;kids&#8221; and helped ourselves to seconds. Such fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I left the real kids to it while I made myself a much needed real cuppa.  As I wrapped my cold fingers around the steaming cup, my teacher-mama brain wandered.  <em>What would happen if I let the kids have real tea too?</em> <em>Would real tea enhance their play? Would it still be play if the teacups were filled with real tea?  Is it ok for the lines between real life and play to blur? When is play no longer play?  What IS play, anyway?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5289" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea2.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I whipped up some fairy bread* and poured two luke-warm cups of tea into little espresso cups.  Mr 2 ate the bread but wasn&#8217;t at all interested in the real tea.  He much preferred the freedom of the wooden cups &#8211; unconstrained by worries about spilling the liquid, exploring a new taste, or testing the temperature.  Pretend tea in pretend cups is very well behaved!  Miss 5, however, responded quite differently.  She sat straighter. Held her cup carefully. Sipped cautiously.  Made small talk.  Re-enacted the behaviour and conversation she has seen and heard while out at coffee shops with me.  Adding real tea took her play to a new level.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>Was it still play? Maybe she was playing for real?  Or was she just really playing? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5294" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480" /></a><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I don&#8217;t need answers to any of these questions.  Sometimes asking them is the important part. <strong>If as a mother and an educator I stop asking myself questions, then I have fooled myself into thinking I know all there is to know about the way children play, think and learn. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">* For my overseas readers: Fairy Bread is a children&#8217;s party favourite here in Australia. It is simply a piece of buttered bread with hundreds-and-thousands sprinkled on top, and cut into triangles <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/budgie_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3987" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/budgie_collage.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p>We had an unexpected visitor to our backyard in the form of a tame <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgerigar">Budgerigar</a>.  The poor thing was being swooped by our resident <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_Miner">Noisy Miners</a> and seemed unable to fly away.  We could see an identification band around its leg, so assumed it was someone&#8217;s pet.</p>
<p>Using a towel we carefully caught the bird without frightening it.  The only container we had to put the budgie in was the one we also used for the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">frog</a>!  A little on the small side &#8211; but safer than staying in the yard.  Then of course, we had to decide what to do with it.</p>
<p>We printed some simple signs saying FOUND &#8211; YELLOW BUDGIE and a contact number.  Then we walked around our street and put the signs onto telephone poles and into letterboxes.  When we didn&#8217;t hear from anyone for 24hrs we took the bird down to our local vet.</p>
<p>There was so much learning involved in this whole process, and I was able to ask the kids questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of bird is it?</li>
<li>Do you think it&#8217;s wild, or someone&#8217;s pet?</li>
<li>Why do you think it can&#8217;t fly away?</li>
<li>Why shouldn&#8217;t we keep it?</li>
<li>How might the bird be feeling?</li>
<li>What might the bird need to be more comfortable?</li>
<li>How might the bird&#8217;s owner feel?</li>
<li>How far might the bird have come?</li>
<li>How could we find the owner?</li>
<li>What should we write on our sign?</li>
<li>What will we do if we can&#8217;t find the owner?</li>
<li>What do you think the budgie&#8217;s name might be?!</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope our feathered friend has been reunited with its owner <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
