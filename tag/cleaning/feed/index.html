<p>Before having children, cleaning the bathroom tiles involved holding my breath and squirting around the strongest chemicals I could find.  Now that I’m a mum I find I am more conscious of what I use to clean our home, and I’m endeavouring to replace many of these toxic products with natural, chemical-free alternatives.  I have actually been rather reluctant to make the change to green cleaning – partly because I was sceptical it would really work, and partly for fear of being labelled.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/does_green_really_clean.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5530  aligncenter" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/does_green_really_clean-300x212.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a></p>
<p>Yes*. At least, so far so good in our home.  The first green-clean change I made has proven to be incredibly effective, and it’s my number one chemical free cleaning tip.  All I did was switch to using environmentally friendly microfibre cloths.  These cloths have eliminated three quarters of my cleaning products.  There are a few brands on the market, some of which can be purchased off the shelves in the supermarket, and others which are sold through party-plan schemes.  They clean efficiently using only water, and work by trapping dirt in their teeny tiny fibres.  They can be washed and reused many times over too.  We have a lot of glass in our home and I am amazed at how easily I can clean it all with only two cloths and a little water.  And because it’s completely chemical free – the kids can help with cleaning the mirrors, tiles, benches, windows, table and kitchen chairs too!</p>
<p>The next green-clean change I am making is to replace the remaining chemicals I use in our home with natural alternatives.  Instead of viewing the remedies my great grandmother may have used to remove mould as outdated, I am starting to appreciate them for their simplicity.  (Mould has been a widespread problem in Queensland following the drenching we received earlier this year.)  I can only wonder what’s in the bottle of spray in my laundry which claims to eradicate mould, and the smell of the chemical concoction is unbearable.  My great granny would most likely have used tea-tree oil, borax or vinegar.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t call myself a Green Queen yet, but I am definitely making better choices for my family and I am much more aware of the toxins I use in our home.  I still use the odd chemical here and there, which I hope to eventually replace with alternatives that are better both for the environment and for our health.</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you paranoid about germs?  Are you a self proclaimed Green Queen?!  Or like me, do you fall somewhere in between?  Oh, and if you have another green cleaning idea, share it below so we can all try it out!</p></blockquote>
