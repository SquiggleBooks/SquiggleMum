				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging as SquiggleMum in 2008, with an eight week old baby in my arms and a toddler under my feet. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but with two school aged kids and a busy life offline &#8211; I&#8217;m finally ready to let go of SquiggleMum. Well, the mum part anyway. <span id="more-6843"></span></p>
<p>I rarely write about parenting these days, and I feel that stories of my children&#8217;s adventures (or misadventures as the case may be) aren&#8217;t for me to share anymore. So I&#8217;m making a new home online, at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">squigglebooks.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglebooks.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6844" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/squigglebooks-logo1.png" alt="squigglebooks logo1" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">SquiggleBooks</a> you&#8217;ll find a mix of book reviews, posts about children&#8217;s literacy, thoughts about education, and tips for teachers. You&#8217;ll also be able to keep up with the latest news about my own writing career, and definitely be among the first to know <del>if</del> when I land that elusive picture book contract. It&#8217;s a pretty basic site for now, but I expect it will grow and change just as this blog has.</p>
<p>Before I go, I&#8217;d like to thank a bunch of people who have been part of the SquiggleMum journey. There have been thousands of comments on the blog over the years &#8211; <em>thank you</em> to each of you who took time to connect here. Some readers have become friends &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for staying in touch and encouraging me along the way. I have been privileged to write for a number of other parenting sites and share parenting advice on air &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for having me.  I have also won several awards and been invited to speak about blogging at conferences &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for the opportunity. Thank you to the bloggers who have been with me since the beginning &#8211; especially Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a>, as well as Kate from <a href="http://picklebums.com">Picklebums</a>, and Kelly from <a href="http://beafunmum.com/">Be A Fun Mum</a>. (There are too many others to name!)</p>
<p>I hope that many of you will join me in this next chapter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Blessings,</h2>
<h2>Cath / SquiggleMum.</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t often share my works in progress apart from with my <a href="http://www.nswwc.org.au/">NSW Writer&#8217;s Centre</a> critique group, and my January <a href="http://katswhiskers.wordpress.com/whisker-of-poetry/month-of-poetry/">Month of Poetry</a> group. (Honestly, any serious writer should have a crit group.) But the lovely <a href="http://katrinagermein.com/new-in-2014/">Katrina Germein</a> tagged me to share lines 7-14 from a WIP, so I&#8217;m making an exception.<span id="more-6815"></span></p>
<p>This is a snippet from a non-fiction narrative picture book titled, <em><strong>Down By The Billabong</strong></em>. It scored 99% at the CYA Competition in 2013, but sadly has not been picked up by a publisher (YET!) so I&#8217;ve been fiddling with it again. Enjoy&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/640px-Billabong.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6819" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/640px-Billabong.jpg" alt="640px Billabong" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Down by the billabong</em></p>
<p><em>Middle of the day</em></p>
<p><em>When the sun burns hot</em></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">And the gum trees sway,</span></em></p>
<p><em>Wallaby naps,</em></p>
<p><em>Dragonfly rests,</em></p>
<p><em>Turtle snaps,</em></p>
<p><em>Warbler nests.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s over to some of my amazing writerly friends from the above mentioned crit group. The challenge is to share 7 lines from page 7 or 77 of a current WIP, or lines 7-14 from a picture book WIP. Then tag other writers to continue the game. Are you brave enough <a href="http://ramonadavey.com/">Ramona Davey</a> and <a href="http://shellyunwin.com/">Shelly Unwin</a>?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the third year running, I was delighted to be shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/news--updates/winners.html">CYA Competition</a> for unpublished authors in the non-fiction picture books category. And to be honest, I was absolutely stoked to take out both first and second place again with two manuscripts. <span id="more-6755"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cya-winner-2014a.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6756 aligncenter" alt="cya winner 2014a" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cya-winner-2014a.jpg" width="619" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how many unpublished awards one must win before finally landing a contract, but I must be close. Surely?!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my post about <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/award-winning-non-fiction/">winning last year</a> (1st, 2nd and 3rd). And <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/writing-recognition-cya-2012/">the year before</a> (2nd). Maybe next year will be the year I get to sit on the success panel &#8211; like so many of my writer friends.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge of having non-fiction picture books even <em>considered</em> by publishers, I remain determined. I adore those rich books that blur the lines between information and story. As a mother, I love reading them to my kids. As a teacher, I know that there is a need for them, and the new Australian Curriculum demands them. And as a writer, they are my first love.</p>
<p>So I will continue to write them. I will write them and I will win awards for them. I will challenge the notion that non-fiction is boring. I will be a voice for birds and bugs and trees and rocks and everything that amazes kids about the world around them. It still amazes me.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cath-2014-cya-winner.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6758 aligncenter" alt="cath 2014 cya winner" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cath-2014-cya-winner.jpg" width="605" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>As always though, the best part of CYA is the networking. This year my dear friend Kathryn Apel and I were roomies (which meant we stayed up late like schoolgirls talking about, well &#8211; everything). Her verse novel <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/bully-on-the-bus/">Bully on the Bus</a> has been a sellout in its first week! I also managed to draw a few birds with <a href="http://petercarnavas.com/">Peter Carnavas</a>, chat with <a href="http://www.pamelarushby.com/">Pamela Rushby</a> about her latest novel, and catch up with <a href="http://www.michelleworthington.com/">Michelle Worthington</a>. So many friends, so little time.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/kat-and-cath-2014-cya.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6757 aligncenter" alt="kat and cath 2014 cya" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/kat-and-cath-2014-cya.jpg" width="619" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>My thanks to the organisers of <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/">CYA</a>, and especially to the editors who give up their time to judge the competition and offer advice. Congrats to all of the winners in other categories too. &#8216;Til next year&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;This book is about a boy getting bullied every day on the school bus. When I read it I could feel what it&#8217;s like to be bullied. I felt like the main character was me. I hope this book teaches kids not to bully each other. The words in <em><strong>Bully on the Bus</strong></em> are so interesting, and the way it&#8217;s all in poems draws you in. The shape of the poems makes you think about the meaning. Once I started I had to finish the whole story.&#8221; (Miss 8)</p>

<p><em></em>Kat is a dear writing friend and colleague of mine. Maybe I cried when reading <strong><em>Bully on the Bus</em> </strong>because I know the author &#8211; but I suspect it has more to do with her incredible storytelling and poignant touch. (The last sentence on p91 really got me&#8230;)</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Teachers will love the verse novel format. Yes, verse novel. (<a href="http://uqp.uq.edu.au/skins/uqp/_uploads/samplechapter/Bully%20on%20the%20Bus_Sample_Chapter.pdf">See this link for an example of the layout</a>). Rather than being broken into chapters, each section is a poem which stands alone, yet contributes to the narrative. Poems are in free verse, and cleverly shaped to reflect the content. The poetry is easy to read because it&#8217;s not too abstract, but at the same time provides an early introduction to poetic devices and figurative language. </span></p>
<p>The comprehensive <a href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/store/images/Hi-RES/teachersnotes/1297/3322.pdf">teacher&#8217;s notes</a> are aligned with the Australian English Curriculum, and well worth downloading if you are an educator. The examples of poetic devices on specific pages will be useful for teachers (although I think metaphor features more heavily than is mentioned here), and I was pleased to see reference even to peritexts such as the dedication page. An excellent resource.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <em><strong>Bully on the Bus</strong></em> highly enough. As a teacher, a mother and a writer this one gets my tick of approval.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower Primary / Middle Primary classrooms</li>
<li>Exploring poetic forms (including shape poems)</li>
<li>Exploring poetic devices (including metaphor, simile and alliteration)</li>
<li>Family reading</li>
<li>Bullying theme</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rating</strong>:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents often ask me if they should do any &#8220;school work&#8221; with their kids during the long summer holidays. I think everyone needs a break over the holidays, but keeping up some reading and writing is a really good idea. In addition to reading aloud to your child each night, I suggest helping your child to keep a holiday journal.<span id="more-6657"></span></p>
<p>Lots of learning happens during school holidays, and a journal is a great way of recording some of that learning and gives your kids a <em><strong>reason</strong></em> to write. It&#8217;s also very easy to adapt for different ages of children.</p>
<p>Here are my children&#8217;s journal entries for the same day, following our trip to the <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/">Australian Museum</a>. Mr 5 is still an emerging writer, just about to start full time school. Miss 7 is a confident and capable independent writer.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6658" alt="dinosaurs5" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs5.jpg" width="440" height="586" /></a></p>
<p>(On the holidays I&#8230; <em>saw dinosaurs</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6659" alt="dinosaurs7" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs7.jpg" width="406" height="542" /></a></p>
<p>(<i>In the holidays I went to the museum and saw dinosaurs. We went with our friends, Izzy and Mitchell. We went to the minerals witch* was my favourite part of the whole museum. My favourite three minerals are amethyst, sulphur and quartz.)</i></p>
<p>As you can see, my kids are at very different stages. Here are some tips for writing journal entries at different stages.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning Writers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One sentence is enough.</li>
<li>Keep the same sentence structure. (On the holidays I&#8230;)</li>
<li>Provide big lines for little hands to write on.</li>
<li>Cut out tickets, brochures, maps, etc to glue in.</li>
<li>All reasonable spelling attempts are acceptable!</li>
<li>Ask your child to read back their sentence aloud.</li>
<li>Give them praise &#8211; young writers need confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Confident Writers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple sentences, using capitals to begin and full stop to end.</li>
<li>Provide lines for writing, and space for illustration.</li>
<li>Encourage use of specific vocabulary, particularly if new (eg amethyst).</li>
<li>Help your child to identify incorrect* spellings. (&#8220;<em>Are there any words you think don&#8217;t look right?</em>&#8221; Miss7 identified &#8220;favourite&#8221; so we fixed it together. She didn&#8217;t notice &#8220;witch&#8221; so I didn&#8217;t mention it.)</li>
<li>Ask your child to read back their recount aloud.</li>
<li>Give your child specific praise (eg <i>I like the way you remembered to use capital letters for your friends&#8217; names).</i></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Have your kids kept a journal these holidays? </strong></em></p>

<p>His list says bananas, muesli bars, watermelon and butter. You might notice that he has used only consonants and no vowels (a e i o u) at all. This is perfectly normal for an emergent writer and I did not correct his work.</p>
<p>Parents often ask me about how to help their child with early writing attempts. Should you correct their work? Should you give them praise if the word isn&#8217;t right? What should you say when they ask how to spell something? Here&#8217;s my advice.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>In the early stages of learning to write, the focus should be on hearing sounds, identifying sounds, and representing those sounds. If the sounds are correctly identified and represented, the work will be &#8220;readable&#8221; even if an actual word isn&#8217;t written. </strong></span>Here&#8217;s what that looks like in practice:</p>
<p>Mr 5: Watermelon! I want to put watermelon on the list.</p>
<p>Me: Excellent idea. We can get watermelon this week if you write it on your list.</p>
<p>Mr 5: How do I write watermelon?</p>
<p>Me: What can you hear?</p>
<p>Mr 5: <span style="line-height: 1.5;"><em>War-Ta-Me-Lun</em> (four <em>sounds</em>)</span></p>
<p>Me: So what was the first sound?</p>
<p>Mr 5: <em>War</em>-</p>
<p>Me: And how do you write <em>War</em>-?</p>
<p>Mr 5: (draws a W)</p>
<p>Me: Good job! What can you hear next?</p>
<p>Mr 5: <em>War-TA</em>- I can hear a <em>ta</em> and I know how to write a <em>ta</em>!</p>
<p>Me: Great, write it down. You&#8217;ve got <em>wa-ta- </em>what comes next?</p>
<p>Mr 5: <em>War-ta-Mmmmm&#8230; Mm for Mummy. </em></p>
<p>Me: You are such a good writer! Watermelon is a big word to write. Can you hear anything else?</p>
<p>Mr 5: (Whispers to himself <em>Wa-ta-me-</em>) <em>Lllllll</em>. I can hear L.</p>
<p>Me: Well done! Let&#8217;s read your word. (Point to letters written and say corresponding sound) <em>War-Ta-Me-Lun. </em>Watermelon!! Great writing mate.</p>
<p>*   *  *</p>
<p>Here are some things I didn&#8217;t do during our conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&#8217;t give him any answers. When your child asks how to spell or write a word, ask a question back. &#8220;What can you hear?&#8221; is a good one to start with.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t make him write sounds he didn&#8217;t identify. For example, if I had forced the issue, he probably could have identified the sound <em>Nn</em> at the end of watermelon. At this early stage, identifying 4 sounds in a word is brilliant! No need to push harder.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t add in the vowels. He is still a pre-reader, and has plenty of time yet to learn about what words look like, and what else is needed to make up a sound (<em>t + a = ta</em>). This comes later.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t add in any other sounds he missed. If I had gone back over his list and added everything he left out, he would feel less capable as a writer. Getting the word &#8220;right&#8221; isn&#8217;t the goal of early writing. The goal is to effectively communicate. (Again, &#8220;rightness&#8221; comes later.)</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t correct his handwriting. Sure, he has a mix of upper and lower case letters but at this stage it&#8217;s not a big deal. It&#8217;s best to focus on one thing at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this encourages you as a parent, and helps you to feel more equipped to help your pre-schooler with their emerging writing skills. Writing a shopping list together is a simple, purposeful, and achievable activity.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though I have been quieter this year online, I have still been writing as much as ever.  I first started this blog back in 2008 to work on my writing, and build an audience.  It has certainly done that &#8211; and more!  I really like writing for mums, and enjoy the interaction and conversation with others that blogging enables.  But, when it comes down to it, my first love will always be writing for kids.<span id="more-6113"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I was so delighted to receive some recognition for one of my picture book manuscripts at the <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/index.html">CYA Conference</a> on the weekend.  I placed SECOND in the non-fiction picture book category! (With a story about birds&#8230; of course.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CYA-12-collage-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6115" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CYA-12-collage-pic.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>It was so exciting spending the day with other authors, aspiring writers, editors, publishers and industry professionals.  I especially enjoyed meeting author <a href="http://katswhiskers.wordpress.com/">Kathryn Apel</a>. Kat and I have been twitter-friends for a long time, so it was great to finally meet. I also got to catch up with fellow nature nerd Penny from <a href="http://www.wildlifefun4kids.com/">Wildlife Fun 4 Kids</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully from here I will be able to find an interested publisher, and it won&#8217;t be too long before you can get your hands on a copy of one of my picture books&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/identifying-birds-eggs/">keen birdwatcher</a>, Miss 5 knows the scientific names of a few of her favourite species.  The first one she learned was <em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em> &#8211; the scientific name for a Rainbow Lorikeet.  The second was the closely related <em>Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus</em>, or Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.  From this early introduction to scientific names, my daughter discovered that:<span id="more-6001"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>all living things have a common name and scientific name</li>
<li>every different type of living thing has its own special scientific name</li>
<li>scientific names have two words (usually)</li>
<li>scientific names have funny words that sound different to every-day words</li>
<li>animals that are similar might have similar names (eg: first word the same, second word different)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this week, when we discovered an unusual species of fungi in the yard, I asked the kids this question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were the first scientist to discover this amazing species, what would you call it?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I know &#8211; weird, right?!  We discussed its unusual shape, vibrant colour, pungent smell, and &#8220;tentacles&#8221; while thinking of a name.  Miss 5 said the first word should be <em>Fungus </em>(based on her understanding of scientific names).  Maybe <em>Fungus Octopus</em>? What about<em> Fungus Redstar </em>or<em> Fungus Crazy?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em></em>And then&#8230; the game was on!  Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for other fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are the, ahem, un-scientific names of species as decided by the SquiggleKids:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Orangey</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6004" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Rosy </em>(named and written by Mr 3)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Goldiae</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Umbrellus</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids ran with this activity because it was of interest to them.  (Not all kids would find fungi so fascinating!)  Even my three year old wanted to &#8220;write&#8221; his own sign, and I loved seeing his purposeful scribble.  This kind of scribble is early writing at its finest.  I especially liked my daughter&#8217;s <em>Fungus Umbrellus</em>.  We discussed how the word <em>umbrella</em> sounded like an everyday word, but <em>umbrellus</em> sounded like a &#8220;science&#8221; word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both kids were so proud of their efforts too, and couldn&#8217;t wait to show SquiggleDad their discoveries. I think I have a couple of young naturalists on my hands!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An outdoor chalkboard is another project I have had on my to-do list for a while. I love the idea of children having lots of writing and drawing opportunities outdoors.  I often find that writing naturally flows outside without the pressure of a classroom environment or the constraints of A4 paper.  Chalk is inviting too, because of its non-permanent nature and its accessibility for little hands. (<em>In fact, Mr 2 drew his first &#8220;people&#8221; pictures on the chalk board! See bottom left picture.</em>)<span id="more-5569"></span></p>
<p>Since adding <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">basket storage to our fences</a>, I have seen the potential in using fences to enhance the playspace rather than merely marking the garden&#8217;s boundaries.  So, we attached the large blackboard directly to the fence!  I also made a couple of extra smaller blackboards which can be moved around and used as needed.  One is a menu board in the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>, the other is waiting for playful inspiration&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboards.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5570" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboards.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="454" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Purchasing large chalk boards can be expensive. Making them yourself isn&#8217;t!  We bought marine ply for our boards so that they would withstand the outdoor conditions.  The cost was less than $15.  We then gave the plywood two coats of chalkboard paint.  The paint was under $20 and we still have a LOT left over for future projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Oh, and an old teacher-tip for you: <strong>to make chalk drawings semi-permanent, soak the chalk in a strong solution of sugar and water before using</strong>.  I drew the leaves in a corner of the large board, and the word <em>Menu </em>on one of the smaller boards in sugar-soaked chalk.  The kids can rub over them, and they won&#8217;t rub off!  This trick lasts a long time inside, but a good soaking rain will still wash it away outside.  (We used to do this to draw the blue-and-white handwriting lines on the classroom blackboards to save ruling them up every day).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboard-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5572" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboard-sq.jpg" alt="outdoor play blackboard chalk board " width="420" height="420" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">What do you think? Anyone else want to try this easy project?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have long had the idea of putting an actual letterbox in the backyard for the kids to use.  FINALLY I got around to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5443" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Letter writing is such a great, purposeful literacy activity.  It provides a reason to write, and an incentive to write <em><strong>well </strong></em>because you want the recipient to be able to read their letter when they receive it!</p>
<p>I picked up this letterbox from our local (big green) hardware store for around $12.  It&#8217;s nothing fancy, but it does the job perfectly and we don&#8217;t need to worry about it being able to withstand the conditions outside.  We simply screwed it to a low, existing sleeper wall beside the dirt kitchen.</p>
<p>It has already been more than worth the money!  The kids have written so many letters to each other, to Mummy and Daddy, and to friends who have come over to play.  Writing them is fun, reading them is fun, checking the mailbox is fun, and delivering the mail is fun. Of course, everyone participates at their own level.  Miss 5 has been doing some great early writing, using her sound-letter knowledge to have-a-go at writing independently.  She has also worked hard to decode the simple letters I have posted to her.  Mr 2 has enjoyed being the mailman, and posted some excellent scribbles to his sister!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox-coll.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5444" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox-coll.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="484" /></a></p>
<p>If you are looking for an inexpensive, non-permanent, interactive addition for your backyard or playspace&#8230; try a letterbox!  It provides a lovely way for siblings or parent-child to communicate, promotes early reading and writing, and gets kids outside. Ticks all my boxes <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
