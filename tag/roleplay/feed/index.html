				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a cold afternoon, and after being outside all I could think about was wrapping my hands around a warm cup of tea.  I put the kettle on, and suggested the kids set up their own tea party for afternoon tea too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5288" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea3.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">They brought their &#8220;kids&#8221; along (a baby and a bear), then set the table with a tablecloth and our Plan Toys wooden tea set.  The three of us enjoyed the role play as we made tea, fed the &#8220;kids&#8221; and helped ourselves to seconds. Such fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I left the real kids to it while I made myself a much needed real cuppa.  As I wrapped my cold fingers around the steaming cup, my teacher-mama brain wandered.  <em>What would happen if I let the kids have real tea too?</em> <em>Would real tea enhance their play? Would it still be play if the teacups were filled with real tea?  Is it ok for the lines between real life and play to blur? When is play no longer play?  What IS play, anyway?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5289" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea2.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480" /></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I whipped up some fairy bread* and poured two luke-warm cups of tea into little espresso cups.  Mr 2 ate the bread but wasn&#8217;t at all interested in the real tea.  He much preferred the freedom of the wooden cups &#8211; unconstrained by worries about spilling the liquid, exploring a new taste, or testing the temperature.  Pretend tea in pretend cups is very well behaved!  Miss 5, however, responded quite differently.  She sat straighter. Held her cup carefully. Sipped cautiously.  Made small talk.  Re-enacted the behaviour and conversation she has seen and heard while out at coffee shops with me.  Adding real tea took her play to a new level.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>Was it still play? Maybe she was playing for real?  Or was she just really playing? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5294" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/afternoon-tea.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="480" /></a><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I don&#8217;t need answers to any of these questions.  Sometimes asking them is the important part. <strong>If as a mother and an educator I stop asking myself questions, then I have fooled myself into thinking I know all there is to know about the way children play, think and learn. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">* For my overseas readers: Fairy Bread is a children&#8217;s party favourite here in Australia. It is simply a piece of buttered bread with hundreds-and-thousands sprinkled on top, and cut into triangles <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/lion_tiger_tea.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4734" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/lion_tiger_tea.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="504" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">There are lots of gorgeous teasets available for little girls, but ones that are gender-neutral, or suitable for boys, are quite hard to find.  I don&#8217;t want my son to think that kitchen things are just for girls!  Mr 2 loves to make &#8220;cups of coffee&#8221; for visitors (or for his Dad) and this wooden set is perfect for him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">This week I helped him to take his &#8220;cup of coffee&#8221; play a step further, and set up a little table in his room.  The R-O-A-R sign was already on his bedroom wall so seemed the logical place for lions and tigers to catch up for coffee!  I must say the Big Cats were very well mannered. They even blew on their coffee to cool it down.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We might follow up this play with a trip to the library to see if we can find the classic 60&#8217;s picture book &#8220;<em>The Tiger Who Came To Tea</em>&#8221; as well.  It seems rather appropriate, don&#8217;t you think? (For another post related to this picture book, jump over to <a href="http://childhood101.com/2010/07/do-good-stories-ever-go-out-of-fashion/">Childhood101</a>).</p>
