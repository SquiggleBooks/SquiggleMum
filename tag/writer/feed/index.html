				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging as SquiggleMum in 2008, with an eight week old baby in my arms and a toddler under my feet. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but with two school aged kids and a busy life offline &#8211; I&#8217;m finally ready to let go of SquiggleMum. Well, the mum part anyway. <span id="more-6843"></span></p>
<p>I rarely write about parenting these days, and I feel that stories of my children&#8217;s adventures (or misadventures as the case may be) aren&#8217;t for me to share anymore. So I&#8217;m making a new home online, at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">squigglebooks.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglebooks.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6844" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/squigglebooks-logo1.png" alt="squigglebooks logo1" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">SquiggleBooks</a> you&#8217;ll find a mix of book reviews, posts about children&#8217;s literacy, thoughts about education, and tips for teachers. You&#8217;ll also be able to keep up with the latest news about my own writing career, and definitely be among the first to know <del>if</del> when I land that elusive picture book contract. It&#8217;s a pretty basic site for now, but I expect it will grow and change just as this blog has.</p>
<p>Before I go, I&#8217;d like to thank a bunch of people who have been part of the SquiggleMum journey. There have been thousands of comments on the blog over the years &#8211; <em>thank you</em> to each of you who took time to connect here. Some readers have become friends &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for staying in touch and encouraging me along the way. I have been privileged to write for a number of other parenting sites and share parenting advice on air &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for having me.  I have also won several awards and been invited to speak about blogging at conferences &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for the opportunity. Thank you to the bloggers who have been with me since the beginning &#8211; especially Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a>, as well as Kate from <a href="http://picklebums.com">Picklebums</a>, and Kelly from <a href="http://beafunmum.com/">Be A Fun Mum</a>. (There are too many others to name!)</p>
<p>I hope that many of you will join me in this next chapter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Blessings,</h2>
<h2>Cath / SquiggleMum.</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I should start by saying &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6713" alt="peppa pig" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg" width="286" height="176" /></a></p>
<p>But poor Peppa has been under fire recently thanks to a <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00283/full">new study</a> into the effect of anthropomorphic picture books on children&#8217;s knowledge about animals. <span id="more-6712"></span>Anthropomorphism is the literary device by which we give human characteristics to non-human things, often animals. Anthropomorphism has long been in prevalent in children&#8217;s literature: <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> are excellent examples, and then of course there are all of Beatrix Potter&#8217;s sweet books. The study found that &#8220;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">anthropomorphized animals in books may not only lead to less learning but also influence children&#8217;s conceptual knowledge of animals.&#8221; This, of course, has upset Peppa Pig fans. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is nothing wrong with anthropomorphism (and as I said &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig), but I have to agree with the study. </strong></p>
<p>The problem comes when children&#8217;s primary (or only) source of information about animals is a fantastical, human-esque version. Peppa Pig is a lovely pig. But if a child&#8217;s only experience of a pig is Peppa, there are going to be obvious issues with the child&#8217;s conceptual understanding of pigs.</p>
<p>You see, the things I like about Peppa are NOT the things that make her a pig. Quite the contrary. The things I like about Peppa are the humanistic elements of her character. I like that she&#8217;s from a nice family. She plays with her brother. She is polite to her mum. She laughs with her dad. They spend time together. Mostly in muddy puddles. But apart from the mud, none of those things are piggish at all!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6715" alt="pig in mud" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>If you look at the picture books on your child&#8217;s bookshelf, you will probably find the same thing over and over again. <strong>How many books does your child have with animals behaving humanly? And how many with animals actually behaving like animals??</strong> As the study says, &#8220;If we want children to learn new things about animals, we need to expose them to stories that present the animals and their environments in a biologically realistic manner, both in the way that they are depicted and the way they are described.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this is worth serious consideration for parents, teachers, and publishers. <strong>We need more non-fiction. Beautiful, information rich, interesting, read-it-again nonfiction.</strong> Books about piglets, bunnies, and owls might deliver warm fuzzies  &#8211; but our kids deserve to also have books about pig farming, real rabbits and birds of prey. Without a balance of both, they will grow up with a skewed, human-centred perspective of the natural world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2014 feels like a new chapter for me. With both children at school full time, this year marks a new phase of life with lots of new beginnings.<span id="more-6620"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hello-New-Year.png"><img class="wp-image-6627 aligncenter" alt="Hello New Year" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hello-New-Year.png" width="574" height="430" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>New Home.</strong>  The SOLD sign is up! We have purchased a house here in &#8220;The Shire&#8221; and are looking forward to putting our stamp on it. Sydney is our home now. <em>(Must buy new homewares.)</em></li>
<li><strong>New Job.  </strong>I am delighted to have been offered a part-time position working in Gifted and Talented Education. I will be working to extend students from a range of ages across various subject areas. <em>(Must buy new shoes.)</em></li>
<li><strong>New Study.</strong> Oh, and did I mention I&#8217;m going back to uni?! I am very excited about studying my Masters degree in Children&#8217;s Literature at Macquarie University, part time. <em>(Must buy new stationery.)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I think all of that should keep me busy, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I will still be blogging here, about mothering, teaching and writing. Five years ago when I began the blogging journey, I wrote largely about my own children and their early experiences. Now that they are older, I feel their stories are their own to share. I will still write about them occasionally (with their permission), but you will see more general educational posts, more book reviews, and perhaps even some more creative writing from me.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing 2014 with you. You can also stay in touch with me on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum">facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum">twitter</a> or <a href="http://pinterest.com/squigglemum">pinterest</a> if you&#8217;re interested. Happy New Year!</p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://cbca.org.au/bookweek.htm">Book Week</a> means two things: firstly the announcement of the <a href="http://cbca.org.au/winners2013.htm">CBCA winners</a>, and secondly &#8211; costumes!  Most schools have a dress-up day or parade to celebrate Book Week, and kids are invited to dress as a favourite book character. Super exciting if you&#8217;re a kid&#8230; less so if you&#8217;re a mum.<span id="more-6441"></span></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve left it til the last minute, here are some easy ideas you might be able to pull together using items you already have at home:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/rapunzel-squigglemum.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6442 aligncenter" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/rapunzel-squigglemum.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="576" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Rapunzel &#8211; any princessy dress, long wool plaited into your daughter&#8217;s hair</li>
<li>Where&#8217;s Wally &#8211; red and white striped shirt, black rimmed glasses, beanie</li>
<li>Angelina Ballerina &#8211; tutu skirt, add mouse ears to a headband, draw on whiskers with eyeliner</li>
<li>The Tin Man &#8211; just cover your child in alfoil!</li>
<li>Paperbag Princess &#8211; make a &#8220;dress&#8221; out of a roll of brown paper, add a homemade crown</li>
<li>Very Hungry Caterpillar &#8211; green clothing, red beanie with large eyes stuck on, cut a big &#8220;leaf&#8221; out of cardboard</li>
<li>Pippi Longstocking &#8211; pinafore, striped leggings, draw on freckles with eyeliner, plait wire into hair to make the plaits stick up</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have any other last-minute suggestions to add to the list?!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Writing picture books is not for the faint hearted, and any emerging author will agree that it is hard to land that first contract. A little recognition goes a long way in balancing out all of the rejection. That&#8217;s why this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/">CYA Competition</a> was such a confidence booster for me.<span id="more-6327"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/writing-recognition-cya-2012/">Last year I placed 2nd</a> in the unpublished Non-Fiction Picture book category. I was delighted, but it still didn&#8217;t lead to a publishing deal. This year I wanted to <em>really</em> make my mark in the category  &#8211; and I did! <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/program/competition/">Not only did I win 1st place, but I also took out 2nd and 3rd as well.</a> Hopefully one of these three manuscripts will find a home with a publisher, and I will finally move from aspiring author to published.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CYA13-awards.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6328" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/CYA13-awards.jpg" alt="" width="622" height="466" /></a></p>
<p>A few other authors (and a couple of publishers) have asked why I persist with writing creative non-fiction, which is quite hard to have published. The answer is simply because I love it. I fondly remember non-fiction picture books from my childhood, they are my favourite texts to work with in the classroom, and I love exploring them with my own children. I never tire of stories about the natural world, and particularly about Australia&#8217;s incredible diversity of wildlife. Every year when the CBCA shortlist is announced, I jump straight to the <a href="http://cbca.org.au/Shortlist2013.htm#ep">Eve Pownall Award</a> to see who has been nominated for information picture books. This year I highly recommend <em><strong>Python</strong></em> (Walker Books, Nature Storybook Series) and <em><strong>Lyrebird! A True Story</strong></em> (Museum Victoria).</p>
<p>Perhaps, one day, my name will be on the list too&#8230;</p>

<p>If you are in Melbourne this weekend, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://lamingtondrive.com/exhibitions/event/i-ve-an-uncle-ivan/">book launch</a> not to be missed. Friend and colleague, <a href="http://bensillustrations.blogspot.com.au/">Ben Sanders</a>, is launching his first picture book! Ben is a <a href="http://themilkagency.com.au/">graphic designer</a> and illustrator of serious repute. His work regularly appears in mags, newspapers, books and advertising. You&#8217;ve probably seen his cool design work without even knowing. But, after reading &#8220;I&#8217;ve an Uncle Ivan&#8221; with your kids &#8211; you&#8217;re sure to recognise his work in the future.<span id="more-6280"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve an Uncle Ivan&#8221; is a free-wheeling rhyme illustrated in a nostalgic 1950s style that introduces readers to Uncle Ivan, his extended family and 14 different modes of transport. Ivan has a niece on skates, who has two hitchhiking brothers. They have a cousin on a scooter, whose sister drives a Mini&#8230; And so it goes until we meet the whole family, who are travelling to a secret destination on every form of transport from unicycles to bi-planes to trams! </em></p>
<p>And yes, Ben really does have an Uncle called Ivan.</p>
<p>I love the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/endpapers/">endpapers</a> in this cool, quirky book. There&#8217;s even a 3D model that kids can pop out, colour, and build so that they can retell the story and interact with the characters. Check it out!</p>
<p><iframe width="604" height="453" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vCagxDv48dQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="http://lamingtondrive.com/exhibitions/event/i-ve-an-uncle-ivan/">launch</a> this Saturday is bound to be a hoot. Expect lemonade and fairy bread, balloon artist, activities and more. If you get along to it, tell Ben (and his wife and kids) I said hi&#8230;</p>

<p>This is a sweet story which will appeal to young girls, and in my opinion the best of Michelle Worthington&#8217;s work to date. What will Ava wear on a windy, yellow-dress-kind-of-day, when her yellow dress is nowhere to be found? Sophie Norsa&#8217;s illustrations are an absolute delight. A small percentage of the royalties go towards supporting children with Rett Syndrome.</p>

<p>Pete is a friend and colleague. He continues to go from strength to strength with New Frontier, producing stories full of warm and sensitive characters. In <em>The Children Who Loved Books</em>, he challenges the notion that &#8220;stuff&#8221; makes us happy. The two children in the story, Angus and Lucy, don&#8217;t have very much &#8211; but with books and each other they have pretty much everything they need.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>:</p>

<li>Lower primary</li>
<li>Family reading, followed by discussion about wants vs needs</li>
<li>Community story telling, particularly in lower socio economic areas</li>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello again! It's been very good for me to take a break from blogging for the past few months. At first I felt guilty, then relieved. Only after that could I really think about what I want to do with this little patch of the online world.

<p>Hello again! It&#8217;s been very good for me to take a break from blogging for the past few months. At first I felt guilty, then relieved. Only after that could I really think about what I want to do with this little patch of the online world.<span id="more-6168"></span></p>
<p>I love being a blogger and I&#8217;m not ready to give it up yet. It has been a huge blessing in my life and I&#8217;ve had so many wonderful experiences and opportunities through blogging. That said, in order to create space for the &#8220;other&#8221; writing I do (children&#8217;s books &#8211; the reason I started blogging in the first place), I need to make a few changes.</p>
<p>Here are some things I will NOT do in 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>general PR posts</li>
<li>check stats</li>
<li>compare my blog</li>
<li>say &#8220;yes&#8221; without really thinking it through</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some things I WILL do in 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>post weekly (weekly-ish)</li>
<li>review new release picture books</li>
<li>submit more of my own manuscripts to publishers!</li>
<li>say &#8220;no&#8221; without feeling guilty</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but I do think a new year provides an opportunity to assess our lives and consider the direction we are heading. I&#8217;ve noticed a few other bloggers and friends have chosen a word for the year. One of my closest girlfriends has embraced the word <strong>nourish</strong>.</p>
<p>I think my word for this year will be <strong>blessed</strong>. My husband and kids are an incredible blessing. I&#8217;m blessed by friends, my job, our home, our church, the blogging community, and so much more. If you follow me on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum">facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum">twitter</a> or <a href="http://pinterest.com/squigglemum">pinterest</a>, I&#8217;ll be using the hashtag <strong>#blessed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>So what about you? Which word will you aspire to in 2013?</strong></p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though I have been quieter this year online, I have still been writing as much as ever.  I first started this blog back in 2008 to work on my writing, and build an audience.  It has certainly done that &#8211; and more!  I really like writing for mums, and enjoy the interaction and conversation with others that blogging enables.  But, when it comes down to it, my first love will always be writing for kids.<span id="more-6113"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I was so delighted to receive some recognition for one of my picture book manuscripts at the <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/index.html">CYA Conference</a> on the weekend.  I placed SECOND in the non-fiction picture book category! (With a story about birds&#8230; of course.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CYA-12-collage-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6115" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CYA-12-collage-pic.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>It was so exciting spending the day with other authors, aspiring writers, editors, publishers and industry professionals.  I especially enjoyed meeting author <a href="http://katswhiskers.wordpress.com/">Kathryn Apel</a>. Kat and I have been twitter-friends for a long time, so it was great to finally meet. I also got to catch up with fellow nature nerd Penny from <a href="http://www.wildlifefun4kids.com/">Wildlife Fun 4 Kids</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully from here I will be able to find an interested publisher, and it won&#8217;t be too long before you can get your hands on a copy of one of my picture books&#8230;</p>
