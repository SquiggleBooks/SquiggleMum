				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents often ask me if they should do any &#8220;school work&#8221; with their kids during the long summer holidays. I think everyone needs a break over the holidays, but keeping up some reading and writing is a really good idea. In addition to reading aloud to your child each night, I suggest helping your child to keep a holiday journal.<span id="more-6657"></span></p>
<p>Lots of learning happens during school holidays, and a journal is a great way of recording some of that learning and gives your kids a <em><strong>reason</strong></em> to write. It&#8217;s also very easy to adapt for different ages of children.</p>
<p>Here are my children&#8217;s journal entries for the same day, following our trip to the <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/">Australian Museum</a>. Mr 5 is still an emerging writer, just about to start full time school. Miss 7 is a confident and capable independent writer.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6658" alt="dinosaurs5" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs5.jpg" width="440" height="586" /></a></p>
<p>(On the holidays I&#8230; <em>saw dinosaurs</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6659" alt="dinosaurs7" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs7.jpg" width="406" height="542" /></a></p>
<p>(<i>In the holidays I went to the museum and saw dinosaurs. We went with our friends, Izzy and Mitchell. We went to the minerals witch* was my favourite part of the whole museum. My favourite three minerals are amethyst, sulphur and quartz.)</i></p>
<p>As you can see, my kids are at very different stages. Here are some tips for writing journal entries at different stages.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning Writers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One sentence is enough.</li>
<li>Keep the same sentence structure. (On the holidays I&#8230;)</li>
<li>Provide big lines for little hands to write on.</li>
<li>Cut out tickets, brochures, maps, etc to glue in.</li>
<li>All reasonable spelling attempts are acceptable!</li>
<li>Ask your child to read back their sentence aloud.</li>
<li>Give them praise &#8211; young writers need confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Confident Writers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple sentences, using capitals to begin and full stop to end.</li>
<li>Provide lines for writing, and space for illustration.</li>
<li>Encourage use of specific vocabulary, particularly if new (eg amethyst).</li>
<li>Help your child to identify incorrect* spellings. (&#8220;<em>Are there any words you think don&#8217;t look right?</em>&#8221; Miss7 identified &#8220;favourite&#8221; so we fixed it together. She didn&#8217;t notice &#8220;witch&#8221; so I didn&#8217;t mention it.)</li>
<li>Ask your child to read back their recount aloud.</li>
<li>Give your child specific praise (eg <i>I like the way you remembered to use capital letters for your friends&#8217; names).</i></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Have your kids kept a journal these holidays?Â </strong></em></p>
