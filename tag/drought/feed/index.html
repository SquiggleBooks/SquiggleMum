				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you grow up with sprinklers in the back yard?  I have fond memories of spending hot summer days running and jumping through the spray with my sister.  I remember those long green tube-like sprinklers, and the groovy ones that could spin around. I even remember being allowed to run through the sprinklers on the school oval when temperatures reached over 35 deg C.  And then of course there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_'n_Slide">slip&#8217;n&#8217;slide</a>&#8230;<span id="more-5694"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/slip-slide.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5695" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/slip-slide.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="473" /></a></p>
<p>My kids don&#8217;t even know what a sprinkler is.  Water restrictions have been in place for years here in Queensland, and despite the odd <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/brisbane-floods-processing-through-play/">flood</a> or <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/family/cyclone-yasi-and-media-storms/">cyclone</a> &#8211; the grass is still so brown and dry around Brisbane that it crackles under the kids&#8217; feet.  <strong>So can you imagine how excited we are that water restrictions have been eased for a week?!</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">If it&#8217;s been a while since your kids enjoyed water play, try some of these ideas:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Run through the sprinkler.  Make sure you move the sprinkler around the yard every so often so that the garden gets a good watering too.  And for those also in SE Qld, don&#8217;t forget that sprinklers do use a lot of water, and we still have to pay for the extra water we use this week.</li>
<li>Washing up.  This is one of those tasks that mums detest and kids love.  Take a big bowl outside filled with water and a little dishwashing detergent.  Let the kids wash duplo blocks, playdough cutters, dolls, plastic cars, whatever you like. Just sit everything on a towel in the sun to dry.</li>
<li>Water fights.  Depending on the age of your kids, you might like to try soaking each other with spray bottles, water pistols, water balloons or even just the hose.  Kids love it when parents get involved too.</li>
<li>Water walls.  I have seen several <a href="http://progressiveearlychildhoodeducation.blogspot.com/2011/02/planning-new-water-wall-for-water-play.html">posts</a> (via Let The Children Play) and <a href="http://pinterest.com/squigglemum/playscapes/">pinterest</a> pics lately featuring water walls.  I think my kids would really enjoy the challenge of designing their own wall somewhere outside.</li>
<li>Free creative play.  Often the best fun is the fun you make yourself.  Simply put out an assortment of objects and a large container of water, or hose with a trigger nozzle, and see what your kids come up with!  They are bound to entertain themselves.</li>
<li>Bring back the slip&#8217;n&#8217;slide!  (Just remember that little bodies cope with slippin&#8217; and slidin&#8217; far better than grownup bodies.  A trip down memory lane could result in a trip to the hospital.)</li>
</ul>
