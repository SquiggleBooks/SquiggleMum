				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I should start by saying &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6713" alt="peppa pig" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg" width="286" height="176" /></a></p>
<p>But poor Peppa has been under fire recently thanks to a <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00283/full">new study</a> into the effect of anthropomorphic picture books on children&#8217;s knowledge about animals. <span id="more-6712"></span>Anthropomorphism is the literary device by which we give human characteristics to non-human things, often animals. Anthropomorphism has long been in prevalent in children&#8217;s literature: <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> are excellent examples, and then of course there are all of Beatrix Potter&#8217;s sweet books. The study found that &#8220;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">anthropomorphized animals in books may not only lead to less learning but also influence children&#8217;s conceptual knowledge of animals.&#8221; This, of course, has upset Peppa Pig fans. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is nothing wrong with anthropomorphism (and as I said &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig), but I have to agree with the study. </strong></p>
<p>The problem comes when children&#8217;s primary (or only) source of information about animals is a fantastical, human-esque version. Peppa Pig is a lovely pig. But if a child&#8217;s only experience of a pig is Peppa, there are going to be obvious issues with the child&#8217;s conceptual understanding of pigs.</p>
<p>You see, the things I like about Peppa are NOT the things that make her a pig. Quite the contrary. The things I like about Peppa are the humanistic elements of her character. I like that she&#8217;s from a nice family. She plays with her brother. She is polite to her mum. She laughs with her dad. They spend time together. Mostly in muddy puddles. But apart from the mud, none of those things are piggish at all!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6715" alt="pig in mud" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>If you look at the picture books on your child&#8217;s bookshelf, you will probably find the same thing over and over again. <strong>How many books does your child have with animals behaving humanly? And how many with animals actually behaving like animals??</strong> As the study says, &#8220;If we want children to learn new things about animals, we need to expose them to stories that present the animals and their environments in a biologically realistic manner, both in the way that they are depicted and the way they are described.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this is worth serious consideration for parents, teachers, and publishers. <strong>We need more non-fiction. Beautiful, information rich, interesting, read-it-again nonfiction.</strong> Books about piglets, bunnies, and owls might deliver warm fuzzies  &#8211; but our kids deserve to also have books about pig farming, real rabbits and birds of prey. Without a balance of both, they will grow up with a skewed, human-centred perspective of the natural world.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The amazing life cycle of a cicada. We watched this cicada nymph emerge as an adult in our own backyard. Fascinating. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: MUM! You have to see this. It&#8217;s weird. And cool. <em>M-U-M</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5934" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think that&#8217;s a cicada nymph.  Can you see the shell underneath? We sometimes find empty cicada shells, don&#8217;t we? It looks like this little guy didn&#8217;t quite make it out.  <span id="more-5933"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5935" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>A few minutes later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Mum, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s dead after all. He&#8217;s moving!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5936" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: You&#8217;re right! He&#8217;s pulling himself up to the tree now, and I think those wings are getting bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5937" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Now his whole body has come out of the shell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Wow, look how his abdomen curls out like that. It really IS weird and cool. You were right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I know.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5938" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Whoa! Check out his wings!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Are they growing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: No, I think they are just getting bigger as they are drying out. See how they are wrinkly and curled up? I think they need to be all smooth before he can fly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">Butterflies</a> have to wait for their wings to dry before they can fly too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Good thinking. I wonder if all flying insects have to wait for their wings to dry&#8230;?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5939" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Do you think his wings are ready now Mum?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I don&#8217;t know. I guess we&#8217;ll have to keep watching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5940" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: He&#8217;s crawling away from his shell now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Maybe he&#8217;s not quite ready for flying yet&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mr 3: I can get him and &#8220;fly&#8221; him for you if you like</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5 and Me: <strong>NO!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5943" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="398" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>An hour later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Dinner time kids. Time to come inside now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: But I want to see him fly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5942" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Let&#8217;s take one last photo before the sun sets. Can you see how his wings are much closer to his body now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Before they were out flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think he will stay there now until it&#8217;s dark, and fly away in the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5941" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I&#8217;ll check if he&#8217;s gone in the morning&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you have a child who is into bugs, you might like to watch the following 5min documentary snippet from Sir David Attenborough about the life cycle of cicadas in America.  (Stop it at the 4min mark if you aren&#8217;t ready to explain what the male and female adult insects are doing together&#8230;)  In Australia, our cicadas don&#8217;t emerge on mass the same way &#8211; but they are still pretty noisy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My kids are energetic.  Very energetic.  I think most happy, healthy kids are &#8211; but it&#8217;s good to slow them down sometimes and help them to notice life&#8217;s little things.  One way we like to do this outside is to go on a bug hunt.  There are interesting insects and other small creatures all around, but often we don&#8217;t notice them because we are too busy.  Open your child&#8217;s eyes to the wonder of bugs!<span id="more-5707"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/red-bugs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5709" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/red-bugs.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="630" /></a></p>
<p>Although you can go on a bug hunt with nothing but a pair of eyes, kids often respond more enthusiastically when they have a few &#8220;tools&#8221; to use.  You might even like to make up a bug-kit for your child, with some of the following items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Magnifying glass &#8211; for looking up close. Even young kids enjoy the magic of magnification.</li>
<li>Camera or smart phone &#8211; our tech savvy kids are quite used to having Mum&#8217;s phone on hand to take photos of interesting things!  This is a good way to let them have a go at taking photos independently.</li>
<li>Notebook and pencil &#8211; older children may like to make a list (words or pictures) of the insects they find.</li>
<li>Tweezers &#8211; not for bugs!! These can be useful for gently lifting up leaves and bark from the ground to reveal creatures hidden underneath.  Great activity for developing fine motor skills too.</li>
<li>Bug catcher &#8211; Depending on what your kids find, they may want to put an insect into a bug catcher to observe more closely. Unless we are sure an insect is safe to touch, we put critters into the bug catcher by picking up the leaf or stick they are on, rather than picking up the bug.  I encourage my kids to release any creatures they have caught at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities like this also provide an opportunity for conversations about nature. Try asking some of these questions when your child discovers an interesting critter.  Remember that open ended questions require your child to think at a higher level, and create much richer discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Questions</strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stink_bugs.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5711 alignright" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stink_bugs.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="384" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>What colour is it?</li>
<li>How many legs does it have?</li>
<li>Where did you find it?</li>
<li>Is it bigger or smaller than your fingernail?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open Ended Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is it similar to any other bugs you have seen? In what way?</li>
<li>If you were a scientist in charge of naming this creature, what would you call it?</li>
<li>What do you think it eats? Why?</li>
<li>What do you think might eat IT?</li>
<li>Do you think the babies and adults of this bug look the same as each other, or different. Why do you think that?</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Happy hunting!</strong></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[So what is it exactly that makes this show stand out, and attract such a wave of support from parents and children?  Here are 8 (hehehe...) reasons why Octonauts are awesome.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To say the <em><strong>Octonauts</strong></em> have captured my kids&#8217; imaginations is an understatement, and I don&#8217;t think my children are alone!  I&#8217;ve overheard mums talking about the program, and kids role playing their favourite characters.  The Octonauts follows a team of adventure heroes who dive into action whenever there is trouble under the sea.  In  a fleet of aquatic vehicles they rescue amazing sea creatures, explore  incredible new underwater worlds and often save the day before returning  safely to their home base, the Octopod.<span id="more-5581"></span></p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L57l19PWuI&#038;feature=related</p>
<p>So what is it exactly that makes this show stand out, and attract such a  wave of support from parents and children?  Here are 8 (hehehe&#8230;)  reasons why <em><strong>Octonauts </strong></em>are awesome:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong>.  This program is a visual feast.  The talented duo from <a href="http://www.meomi.com/">Meomi </a>create a stunning CGI underwater world which combines true aspects of aquatic life with imaginary elements.</li>
<li><strong>Soundtrack</strong>.  Composer Darren Hendley (who also wrote the music for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/children/olivia/">Olivia</a>) brings to the program a high quality score reminiscent of any sci-fi-action-adventure film.  The music isn&#8217;t limited to opening and closing credits either. It features throughout each ten minute episode, adding to the excitement.</li>
<li><strong>Non-fiction content</strong>.  Each episode features an underwater animal in its natural habitat.  Along with the Octonauts, kids learn about interesting behaviours or unusual characteristics of each animal.</li>
<li><strong>Tried and true formula. </strong>Anyone who has watched their share of sci-fi adventures will recognise the similarities between the Octonauts and the crew from the Enterprise, or SG1, or&#8230;.  (Yes, I am married to a <a href="http://distractable.net">geek</a>).  Strong leader + shy medic + scientist-with-a-Scottish-accent + fearless adventurer = awesome team!</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent entertainment</strong>. Children&#8217;s programs which are &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; make me groan.  I believe television shows for kids should be language-rich, introduce interesting vocabulary, and model excellent use of conversation.  Octonauts more than meets my criteria in this department.</li>
<li><strong>Target age. </strong>There often seems to be a lack of good quality entertainment appropriate for kids in the 4-7 age range.  Between toddlers and tweenagers is a whole stage (which seems to be disappearing) called childhood!!  This program is ideal for lower primary aged kids. Yay!</li>
<li><strong>Environmental awareness</strong>.  I&#8217;m always happy for my kids to watch a television program which encourages them to get back outside after it&#8217;s finished, exploring the natural world and the creatures in it.  The &#8220;<em>Explore! Rescue! Protect!</em>&#8221; tagline of the Octonauts is relevant in any habitat.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>.  This program isn&#8217;t about good-guys and bad-guys.  It&#8217;s about good-guys and misunderstood-guys.  This is particularly important in the context of real animals.  There are no evil animals.  Sometimes creatures can harm us, but it is not because they are &#8220;bad&#8221; in any way.  Usually when animals hurt us it is because they are afraid and are defending themselves or their young.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We took a spontaneous long weekend away to the Sunshine Coast, which is only an hour from home for us.  All four of us really needed the time away from everything, we shared some lovely moments on the beach together:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/beach_boys.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4178" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/beach_boys.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="544" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">The boys learned about water and waves.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/beach_babe.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4179" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/beach_babe.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="544" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">We explored the rock pools (one of our all time favourite family activities).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/beach_creatures.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4180" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/beach_creatures.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="544" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">We discovered new and interesting creatures: hermit crabs, fish, molluscs&#8230; and check out the amazing Spotted Sea Hare we found! (No, I didn&#8217;t know what it was without googling, though I guessed sea slug.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/beach_sandy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4181" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/beach_sandy.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="544" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">And at the end of the day, we wandered the sandy shore together. Happiness.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Holidays with under 5s are full of beautiful moments, but you have to find them.  Holidays with under 5s can also be tiring, challenging, and an organisational nightmare!!  I spoke on radio this week about my top 3 tips for holidaying with toddlers.</p>
<ul>
<li>#1 = make bed times familiar</li>
<li>#2 = work in with toddler routines</li>
<li>#3 = take basic kitchen plastics (2 x plastic fork, spoon, plate, bowl, sippy cup)</li>
</ul>
