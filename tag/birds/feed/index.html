				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://birdlife.org.au/">Bird Week</a>! I don&#8217;t really need an excuse to take my kids birdwatching because it&#8217;s my favourite weekend activity &#8211; but I realise it&#8217;s not a usual outing for most families. If you like the idea of birding but don&#8217;t really know how to tackle it with kids, here are some tips to help you out.<span id="more-6527"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6530" alt="kids birding squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg" width="613" height="408" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go at the right time</strong>. Birds are most active at sunrise and dusk. If your kids are early risers, make the most of it by heading out first thing. There are birds around at any time of day, but they are often less active during the middle of the day which can make it harder to see them.</li>
<li><strong>Pick the right place. </strong>Birds can be found everywhere &#8211; from backyard to beach to bush. However, if you pick your place carefully you will increase your chance of seeing a wider variety of species. I recommend finding a quiet, bushy spot near running water.</li>
<li><strong>Take the right gear</strong>. My kids love packing their own backpack. They take their own binoculars and/or camera, their hat, water bottle, and a snack. I usually also take an Australian bird identification book. (If you prefer something lighter, try a bird app. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/michael-morcombe-david-stewart/id397979505?mt=8">Morcombe &#8211; Stewart eGuide</a> is about the same price as the book but weighs a lot less! There is also a free lite version.)</li>
<li><strong>Wear the right clothing</strong>. Make sure your kids have sensible shoes and clothing for spending time outdoors. It&#8217;s a good idea to pre-apply insect repellant too, especially around ankles. Don&#8217;t forget hat and sunscreen.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the right weather</strong>. The birds won&#8217;t mind if the weather is miserable, but the kids will! Birding in the rain is only for hardcore bird nerds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow up activities for kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a picture of a bird you saw</li>
<li>Count how many birds you saw</li>
<li>Count how many species you saw</li>
<li>Print out a picture of a bird you photographed</li>
<li>Identify a bird you saw using the <a href="http://birdsinbackyards.net/finder">Birds in Backyards Bird Finder</a> or a bird book</li>
<li>Research a bird you saw and find out some interesting facts</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Have you ever been bird watching with your kids? Any other tips to share? </strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the weekend we had the opportunity to visit the <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/">Illawarra Fly treetop walk</a>, and participate in their September <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/specials/ifly-4-kids/">kids holiday program</a>: <strong>Bugs @ the Fly</strong>.<span id="more-6481"></span></p>
<p>We did the bug session first, following our guide from Wildlife Sydney Zoo to a couple of tents tucked into the bushland. As well as hearing all about insects and arachnids, the kids got to interact with a range of invertebrates. They enjoyed holding the giant millipede, investigating meal worms and hunting for stick insects.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/meal-worms.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6484 aligncenter" alt="meal worms" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/meal-worms-695x1024.jpg" width="483" height="711" /></a></p>
<p>After the session we headed to the treetop walk itself. It&#8217;s quite a structure, and one of the most substantial suspended walkways we have visited. Knight&#8217;s Tower provides an amazing view over the Illawarra escarpment and right out to the ocean. Despite being constructed entirely of steel, be warned that the springboard cantilever sections do sway slightly (which unnerved my 7yr old)! The Fly really does give kids a chance to check out life in the tree tops, and see the rainforest from a new perspective.<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/treetop-boy2.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-6485 aligncenter" alt="treetop boy2" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/treetop-boy2-682x1024.jpeg" width="483" height="725" /></a></p>
<p>Things to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birds &#8211; some colourful species we saw included <a href="http://birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthorhynchus-tenuirostris">Eastern Spinebills</a>, <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Malurus-lamberti">Variegated Fairy-wrens</a>, and <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Eopsaltria-australis">Eastern Yellow Robins</a>. We even glimpsed a <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Menura-novaehollandiae">Superb Lyrebird</a> on the way home!</li>
<li>Tree hollows &#8211; how many can you count from the tree top walk? What might live there?</li>
<li>Wombat home &#8211; can you find the wombat crossing? Wombat hollow? Wombat letterbox?!</li>
<li>Steps &#8211; how many steps can you count on the way up to Knight&#8217;s Tower?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/knights-tower.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-6488 aligncenter" alt="knights tower" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/knights-tower-682x1024.jpeg" width="483" height="725" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/">Illawarra Fly</a> has great facilities for families, including cafe with indoor and outdoor seating, picnic tables, and clean toilets. Book online for best value tickets. The kids holiday program, <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/specials/ifly-4-kids/">iFly 4 Kids</a> (which includes entry to The Fly) does sell out quickly, so book early for the Christmas holidays!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have talked a lot about life and death in our home over the last week.  It&#8217;s a heavy topic, but circumstances meant discussing death was unavoidable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6026" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing that happened was that a young mum from our church passed away.  The kids understandably had some questions&#8230;<span id="more-5996"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mummy why are you sad?</li>
<li>What is a funeral?</li>
<li>What happens when people die?</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>I&#8217;m crying because a very sad thing happened -everybody cries sometimes.  A funeral is like a special church service where thank God for someone&#8217;s life, and celebrate what was wonderful about them even though we are sad.  And I believe that when we die, those who have accepted Jesus live forever with Him. </em></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6022" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The second thing that happened was that two of our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finch-love/">Gouldian Finch</a> eggs hatched.  The pair had been sitting on four tiny eggs.  Unfortunately a common behaviour of Gouldians is to &#8220;pitch&#8221; their young.  For a range of reasons, the parents toss their own chicks out of the nest.  Sadly our finches pitched their two chicks, and despite our attempts to return them to the nest, we were unable to save them.  The other two eggs did not hatch.  Again, the kids had questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did they throw their babies?</li>
<li>Why didn&#8217;t the other eggs hatch?</li>
<li>Should we bury them?</li>
<li>Why is nature so unfair?</li>
<li>Why do some creatures live and some die?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It is unfair, isn&#8217;t it? Sometimes Gouldians pitch their young because the chicks aren&#8217;t healthy, and sometimes because they just aren&#8217;t ready to be parents yet.  (Aren&#8217;t you glad I&#8217;m not a Mummy Finch?! I would never pitch you.)  I don&#8217;t know why the other two eggs didn&#8217;t hatch. Perhaps they didn&#8217;t grow properly inside, or maybe the parents didn&#8217;t keep them warm enough.  It&#8217;s hard to understand, but it&#8217;s important to remember that everything that lives &#8211; dies one day.  Yes, we can bury them together.  Let&#8217;s dig a little hole&#8230; </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6029" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>And thirdly, this weekend is Easter.  Today is Good Friday, the day we reflect on Jesus&#8217; death on the cross.  Sunday is coming, the day we celebrate His resurrection.  And the kids have questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why isn&#8217;t it called Bad Friday?</li>
<li>Why did Jesus die?</li>
<li>When can we have Easter eggs?!</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It does seem like a funny name because bad stuff happened and it was really sad when Jesus died on the cross.  But we call it Good Friday because it was good that Jesus came, good that He did all the things God sent Him to do, and good because the job was finished on the cross.  Jesus died for us so that we can all have new life.  Today we eat hot cross buns to remind us of the cross, and on Sunday, we&#8217;ll eat Easter eggs because eggs remind us of new life!</em></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/identifying-birds-eggs/">keen birdwatcher</a>, Miss 5 knows the scientific names of a few of her favourite species.  The first one she learned was <em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em> &#8211; the scientific name for a Rainbow Lorikeet.  The second was the closely related <em>Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus</em>, or Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.  From this early introduction to scientific names, my daughter discovered that:<span id="more-6001"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>all living things have a common name and scientific name</li>
<li>every different type of living thing has its own special scientific name</li>
<li>scientific names have two words (usually)</li>
<li>scientific names have funny words that sound different to every-day words</li>
<li>animals that are similar might have similar names (eg: first word the same, second word different)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this week, when we discovered an unusual species of fungi in the yard, I asked the kids this question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were the first scientist to discover this amazing species, what would you call it?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I know &#8211; weird, right?!  We discussed its unusual shape, vibrant colour, pungent smell, and &#8220;tentacles&#8221; while thinking of a name.  Miss 5 said the first word should be <em>Fungus </em>(based on her understanding of scientific names).  Maybe <em>Fungus Octopus</em>? What about<em> Fungus Redstar </em>or<em> Fungus Crazy?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em></em>And then&#8230; the game was on!  Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for other fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are the, ahem, un-scientific names of species as decided by the SquiggleKids:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Orangey</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6004" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Rosy </em>(named and written by Mr 3)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Goldiae</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Umbrellus</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids ran with this activity because it was of interest to them.  (Not all kids would find fungi so fascinating!)  Even my three year old wanted to &#8220;write&#8221; his own sign, and I loved seeing his purposeful scribble.  This kind of scribble is early writing at its finest.  I especially liked my daughter&#8217;s <em>Fungus Umbrellus</em>.  We discussed how the word <em>umbrella</em> sounded like an everyday word, but <em>umbrellus</em> sounded like a &#8220;science&#8221; word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both kids were so proud of their efforts too, and couldn&#8217;t wait to show SquiggleDad their discoveries. I think I have a couple of young naturalists on my hands!</p>

<p>&#8230;which of course lead us into a discussion about Narelle&#8217;s award winning picture book, <strong><em>Fox and Fine Feathers, </em></strong>with her signature linocut illustrations.<span id="more-5982"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5983" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Lyrebird, Coucal, Pitta and Nightjar are birds of the forest floor. Although as different as groundbirds can be, they always look out for danger and warn each other to hide. One day, Lyrebird, Coucal and Pitta forget to look out for Fox. Only Nightjar is watching. Can he warn the others in time?</em></p>
<p>We loved learning more about these four beautiful Australian rainforest birds from the story:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superb Lyrebirds</strong> are incredibly shy creatures.  They are rarely seen, but often heard as they mimic the calls of other birds.  Males have long, intricate tail feathers.</li>
<li><strong>Pheasant Coucals</strong> are sizeable black and brown birds. They are not particularly adept at flying, so prefer to run after their prey.</li>
<li><strong>Noisy Pittas</strong> are brightly coloured little rainforest birds.  They hop about in the undergrowth, and although quite common are not often seen.</li>
<li><strong>Long-tailed Nightjars</strong> are masters of disguise.  Their feathers are perfectly camouflaged amongst the leaf litter during the day while they sleep.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5986" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="313" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: left"></div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to talking about birds, we also discussed the problems introduced species, such as foxes, can cause to fragile ecosystems.  Other introduced species to Australia include cane toads, rabbits, and (feral) cats.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This picture book is not only a wonderful read, but is rich with opportunities to discuss habitats, birdlife, camouflage, predators and more.  Great for low to mid primary, and any kids with an interest in wildlife.  (For my teacher friends, Scholastic provide <a href="http://www.scholastic.com.au/schools/education/teacherresources/assets/pdfs/Fox_and_Fine_Feathers.pdf">Teachers&#8217; Notes</a> on <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for classroom use.)</div>
<p><strong>Courtesy of Narelle Oliver herself, I have a SIGNED copy of <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for one lucky SquiggleMum reader.  To enter, simply leave a comment below and tell me an Australian bird that your kids have seen in your area.  </strong>(It&#8217;s a great excuse to  look out for birds this week&#8230;)  One entry per person, Aussie residents only, comp closes Sun 18/3/12 8pm Qld time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stick_sculpture2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4057" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stick_sculpture2.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>After <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/boys/birthday-boy-and-bear/">Mr 2&#8217;s birthday</a> there were lots of new and exciting gifts to open.  Several toys were wired into boxes with clear coated wires about 20cm each in length.  I kept them, figuring they would come in handy for something.  It&#8217;s a teacher thing &#8211; we can&#8217;t help ourselves!!</p>
<p>The kids collected a nice bunch of sticks from the backyard the other day, and we played around with them for a while before deciding to turn them into a &#8220;sculpture&#8221;.  (This is a word Miss 4 knows from visiting the Art Gallery and exploring different mediums with her artist-Nanna.)  My daughter&#8217;s first suggestion was to attach the sticks to each other with sticky tape.  We discussed whether sticky tape would hold very well to the bark and wood, and decided string would be better.  When we went to get some string, we discovered the wires!  Perfect!!</p>
<p>Wiring the sticks together was fiddly for a four year old, but fantastic for fine motor skill development.  She put the sticks and wires where she wanted them, and I just tightened up the joints.  It was also her idea to add some feathers into the joints, and I think the final result is rather lovely.</p>
<p>The sculpture is sitting on top of a skinny cabinet in the hallway just beside the back door.  This Ikea cabinet is fabulous because everyone in the family has their own drawer for outside boots and hats!  The birdcage decals run right along the hallway, so my daughter&#8217;s addition of feathers to the sticks seems just right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stick_sculpture1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4058" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stick_sculpture1.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/budgie_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3987" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/budgie_collage.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p>We had an unexpected visitor to our backyard in the form of a tame <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budgerigar">Budgerigar</a>.  The poor thing was being swooped by our resident <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_Miner">Noisy Miners</a> and seemed unable to fly away.  We could see an identification band around its leg, so assumed it was someone&#8217;s pet.</p>
<p>Using a towel we carefully caught the bird without frightening it.  The only container we had to put the budgie in was the one we also used for the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">frog</a>!  A little on the small side &#8211; but safer than staying in the yard.  Then of course, we had to decide what to do with it.</p>
<p>We printed some simple signs saying FOUND &#8211; YELLOW BUDGIE and a contact number.  Then we walked around our street and put the signs onto telephone poles and into letterboxes.  When we didn&#8217;t hear from anyone for 24hrs we took the bird down to our local vet.</p>
<p>There was so much learning involved in this whole process, and I was able to ask the kids questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of bird is it?</li>
<li>Do you think it&#8217;s wild, or someone&#8217;s pet?</li>
<li>Why do you think it can&#8217;t fly away?</li>
<li>Why shouldn&#8217;t we keep it?</li>
<li>How might the bird be feeling?</li>
<li>What might the bird need to be more comfortable?</li>
<li>How might the bird&#8217;s owner feel?</li>
<li>How far might the bird have come?</li>
<li>How could we find the owner?</li>
<li>What should we write on our sign?</li>
<li>What will we do if we can&#8217;t find the owner?</li>
<li>What do you think the budgie&#8217;s name might be?!</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope our feathered friend has been reunited with its owner <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/my-budding-birder/">bird-loving daughter</a> (yep, she gets it from me) found an egg at kindy.  According to her the egg is &#8220;creamish with brown speckles&#8221; and she found it on the concrete under a few trees.  We took a photo on the iphone, then googled it at home.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bird_egg_childfinger.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3623" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/bird_egg_childfinger.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Turns out it&#8217;s quite tricky to identify eggs online.  We <em>tried </em>looking for an identification guide, but no luck.  We <em>tried</em> searching for the eggs of common birds around our area, but that proved an overwhelming task.  So instead, we thought about who we could ask for help online.  We decided to email the  museum!  I helped my big 4 year old to compose her email which went something like this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>I found an egg at my kindy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>It is creamish and has brown speckles.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>I looked but I couldn&#8217;t see a nest.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong> I think it is a sparrow egg.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>What do you think it is?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We sent the email off and I sent the girl off to bed!  (While she was asleep I sent the same email to a second museum to increase our chances of hearing back from at least one&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We were delighted to receive speedy emails responses from BOTH museums.  The <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/discoverycentre/">Discovery Centre</a> at the Melbourne Museum emailed back the next day, with a detailed response from the Manager of Mammalogy and Ornithology and a child-friendly explanation from a Discovery Centre team member.  (So of course I gave them a shoutout on <a href="http://twitter.com/discoverycentre">twitter</a>.)  Shortly after we also received an email from an information officer at the <a href="http://www.qm.qld.gov.au/Find%20Out%20About.aspx?id={EE19F685-4C1D-B035-BAA7-C94672F9425A}">Queensland Museum</a>.  It too was informative and child-friendly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">As a teacher I was thrilled to see that big museums around Australia are not too busy to answer a young child&#8217;s request, and as a mother I was so touched by the thoughtfulness of each message.</p>
<p><strong>If only they had both come back with the same answer!!</strong> The options are Noisy Miner, Welcome Swallow, House Sparrow, Magpie Lark or Eurasian Blackbird.  What do you think?</p>
