				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/identifying-birds-eggs/">keen birdwatcher</a>, Miss 5 knows the scientific names of a few of her favourite species.  The first one she learned was <em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em> &#8211; the scientific name for a Rainbow Lorikeet.  The second was the closely related <em>Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus</em>, or Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.  From this early introduction to scientific names, my daughter discovered that:<span id="more-6001"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>all living things have a common name and scientific name</li>
<li>every different type of living thing has its own special scientific name</li>
<li>scientific names have two words (usually)</li>
<li>scientific names have funny words that sound different to every-day words</li>
<li>animals that are similar might have similar names (eg: first word the same, second word different)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this week, when we discovered an unusual species of fungi in the yard, I asked the kids this question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were the first scientist to discover this amazing species, what would you call it?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I know &#8211; weird, right?!  We discussed its unusual shape, vibrant colour, pungent smell, and &#8220;tentacles&#8221; while thinking of a name.  Miss 5 said the first word should be <em>Fungus </em>(based on her understanding of scientific names).  Maybe <em>Fungus Octopus</em>? What about<em> Fungus Redstar </em>or<em> Fungus Crazy?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em></em>And then&#8230; the game was on!  Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for other fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are the, ahem, un-scientific names of species as decided by the SquiggleKids:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Orangey</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6004" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Rosy </em>(named and written by Mr 3)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Goldiae</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Umbrellus</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids ran with this activity because it was of interest to them.  (Not all kids would find fungi so fascinating!)  Even my three year old wanted to &#8220;write&#8221; his own sign, and I loved seeing his purposeful scribble.  This kind of scribble is early writing at its finest.  I especially liked my daughter&#8217;s <em>Fungus Umbrellus</em>.  We discussed how the word <em>umbrella</em> sounded like an everyday word, but <em>umbrellus</em> sounded like a &#8220;science&#8221; word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both kids were so proud of their efforts too, and couldn&#8217;t wait to show SquiggleDad their discoveries. I think I have a couple of young naturalists on my hands!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This summer has been so damp here in Brisbane, and while the resulting mould inside the house is NOT fun, the fungi growing outside has been amazing!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fungi_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4826" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/fungi_collage.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="504" /></a></p>
<p>The great thing about having multiple species in one area is that the kids have been able to compare them.  We&#8217;ve been able to talk about</p>
<ul>
<li>colour</li>
<li>size</li>
<li>shape</li>
<li>smell</li>
</ul>
<p>and identify similarities and differences.  We haven&#8217;t touched the fungi in our yard.  Many species are harmless, and most are only problematic if eaten, but I cannot guarantee that a 2yr old (or even a nature loving 4yr old) will keep hands away from little eyes and mouths.  I am particularly cautious with red and yellow species as these are often &#8220;danger&#8221; colours in the Australian bush.</p>
<p>My blogging friend and educator Juliet from Creative Star Learning in the UK has some thoughts on <a href="http://creativestarlearning.blogspot.com/2010/10/good-bad-and-fungi.html">children and fungi</a>, and whether or not kids should be encouraged to touch. Please note that her recommendations are for Scotland though and NOT for Australia.</p>
<p>Without doubt though, the best species we have had in our yard is this one below.  It is definitely from the Stinkhorn family (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phallaceae">Phallaceae </a>or Dictyophora of some kind I&#8217;m guessing).  Stinkhorns grow from a button just below the surface, and stink like rotting meat when they emerge!  Miss 4 can tell if one is around the second we walk outside.  Flies and other insects are attracted to the stinky slime and swarm around.  They aren&#8217;t small, yet seem to pop up over night. Absolutely fascinating.</p>
