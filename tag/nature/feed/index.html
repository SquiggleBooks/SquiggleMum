				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t often share my works in progress apart from with my <a href="http://www.nswwc.org.au/">NSW Writer&#8217;s Centre</a> critique group, and my January <a href="http://katswhiskers.wordpress.com/whisker-of-poetry/month-of-poetry/">Month of Poetry</a> group. (Honestly, any serious writer should have a crit group.) But the lovely <a href="http://katrinagermein.com/new-in-2014/">Katrina Germein</a> tagged me to share lines 7-14 from a WIP, so I&#8217;m making an exception.<span id="more-6815"></span></p>
<p>This is a snippet from a non-fiction narrative picture book titled, <em><strong>Down By The Billabong</strong></em>. It scored 99% at the CYA Competition in 2013, but sadly has not been picked up by a publisher (YET!) so I&#8217;ve been fiddling with it again. Enjoy&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/640px-Billabong.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6819" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/640px-Billabong.jpg" alt="640px Billabong" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Down by the billabong</em></p>
<p><em>Middle of the day</em></p>
<p><em>When the sun burns hot</em></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">And the gum trees sway,</span></em></p>
<p><em>Wallaby naps,</em></p>
<p><em>Dragonfly rests,</em></p>
<p><em>Turtle snaps,</em></p>
<p><em>Warbler nests.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s over to some of my amazing writerly friends from the above mentioned crit group. The challenge is to share 7 lines from page 7 or 77 of a current WIP, or lines 7-14 from a picture book WIP. Then tag other writers to continue the game. Are you brave enough <a href="http://ramonadavey.com/">Ramona Davey</a> and <a href="http://shellyunwin.com/">Shelly Unwin</a>?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the third year running, I was delighted to be shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/news--updates/winners.html">CYA Competition</a> for unpublished authors in the non-fiction picture books category. And to be honest, I was absolutely stoked to take out both first and second place again with two manuscripts. <span id="more-6755"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cya-winner-2014a.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6756 aligncenter" alt="cya winner 2014a" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cya-winner-2014a.jpg" width="619" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how many unpublished awards one must win before finally landing a contract, but I must be close. Surely?!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my post about <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/award-winning-non-fiction/">winning last year</a> (1st, 2nd and 3rd). And <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/writing-recognition-cya-2012/">the year before</a> (2nd). Maybe next year will be the year I get to sit on the success panel &#8211; like so many of my writer friends.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge of having non-fiction picture books even <em>considered</em> by publishers, I remain determined. I adore those rich books that blur the lines between information and story. As a mother, I love reading them to my kids. As a teacher, I know that there is a need for them, and the new Australian Curriculum demands them. And as a writer, they are my first love.</p>
<p>So I will continue to write them. I will write them and I will win awards for them. I will challenge the notion that non-fiction is boring. I will be a voice for birds and bugs and trees and rocks and everything that amazes kids about the world around them. It still amazes me.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cath-2014-cya-winner.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6758 aligncenter" alt="cath 2014 cya winner" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cath-2014-cya-winner.jpg" width="605" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>As always though, the best part of CYA is the networking. This year my dear friend Kathryn Apel and I were roomies (which meant we stayed up late like schoolgirls talking about, well &#8211; everything). Her verse novel <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/bully-on-the-bus/">Bully on the Bus</a> has been a sellout in its first week! I also managed to draw a few birds with <a href="http://petercarnavas.com/">Peter Carnavas</a>, chat with <a href="http://www.pamelarushby.com/">Pamela Rushby</a> about her latest novel, and catch up with <a href="http://www.michelleworthington.com/">Michelle Worthington</a>. So many friends, so little time.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/kat-and-cath-2014-cya.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6757 aligncenter" alt="kat and cath 2014 cya" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/kat-and-cath-2014-cya.jpg" width="619" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>My thanks to the organisers of <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/">CYA</a>, and especially to the editors who give up their time to judge the competition and offer advice. Congrats to all of the winners in other categories too. &#8216;Til next year&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>SquiggleKid&#8217;s comments (aged7)</strong>:<img title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I&#8217;ve read lots of Rainbow Magic Fairies books, so when I heard about the Wilderness Fairies I was very interested. I was hoping that these books by Jodie Wells-Slowgrove would be a bit more interesting (because the Rainbow Magic books are ALL the same)!</span></p>
<p>I was right. The Wilderness Fairies books are much more interesting and I really enjoyed them. In the first book, Daisy&#8217;s Quest, we meet Daisy and a lot of other Australian creatures that help her on her quest to find her wings. In the second book, Daisy learns how to use them. Wings are more troublesome than she expects.</p>
<p>I found these books easy to read. The pictures helped me to understand what was going on. I really liked the setting because I know about the Australian bush. I think 7-9 year olds will enjoy the series. There are some great colouring pages at the <a href="http://www.wildernessfairies.com/">Wilderness Fairies website</a>. I can&#8217;t wait for books three and four!</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>kids who like the Rainbow Magic series</li>
<li>easy chapter books</li>
<li>discussing the Australian bush</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://birdlife.org.au/">Bird Week</a>! I don&#8217;t really need an excuse to take my kids birdwatching because it&#8217;s my favourite weekend activity &#8211; but I realise it&#8217;s not a usual outing for most families. If you like the idea of birding but don&#8217;t really know how to tackle it with kids, here are some tips to help you out.<span id="more-6527"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6530" alt="kids birding squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg" width="613" height="408" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go at the right time</strong>. Birds are most active at sunrise and dusk. If your kids are early risers, make the most of it by heading out first thing. There are birds around at any time of day, but they are often less active during the middle of the day which can make it harder to see them.</li>
<li><strong>Pick the right place. </strong>Birds can be found everywhere &#8211; from backyard to beach to bush. However, if you pick your place carefully you will increase your chance of seeing a wider variety of species. I recommend finding a quiet, bushy spot near running water.</li>
<li><strong>Take the right gear</strong>. My kids love packing their own backpack. They take their own binoculars and/or camera, their hat, water bottle, and a snack. I usually also take an Australian bird identification book. (If you prefer something lighter, try a bird app. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/michael-morcombe-david-stewart/id397979505?mt=8">Morcombe &#8211; Stewart eGuide</a> is about the same price as the book but weighs a lot less! There is also a free lite version.)</li>
<li><strong>Wear the right clothing</strong>. Make sure your kids have sensible shoes and clothing for spending time outdoors. It&#8217;s a good idea to pre-apply insect repellant too, especially around ankles. Don&#8217;t forget hat and sunscreen.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the right weather</strong>. The birds won&#8217;t mind if the weather is miserable, but the kids will! Birding in the rain is only for hardcore bird nerds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow up activities for kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a picture of a bird you saw</li>
<li>Count how many birds you saw</li>
<li>Count how many species you saw</li>
<li>Print out a picture of a bird you photographed</li>
<li>Identify a bird you saw using the <a href="http://birdsinbackyards.net/finder">Birds in Backyards Bird Finder</a> or a bird book</li>
<li>Research a bird you saw and find out some interesting facts</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Have you ever been bird watching with your kids? Any other tips to share? </strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the weekend we had the opportunity to visit the <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/">Illawarra Fly treetop walk</a>, and participate in their September <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/specials/ifly-4-kids/">kids holiday program</a>: <strong>Bugs @ the Fly</strong>.<span id="more-6481"></span></p>
<p>We did the bug session first, following our guide from Wildlife Sydney Zoo to a couple of tents tucked into the bushland. As well as hearing all about insects and arachnids, the kids got to interact with a range of invertebrates. They enjoyed holding the giant millipede, investigating meal worms and hunting for stick insects.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/meal-worms.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6484 aligncenter" alt="meal worms" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/meal-worms-695x1024.jpg" width="483" height="711" /></a></p>
<p>After the session we headed to the treetop walk itself. It&#8217;s quite a structure, and one of the most substantial suspended walkways we have visited. Knight&#8217;s Tower provides an amazing view over the Illawarra escarpment and right out to the ocean. Despite being constructed entirely of steel, be warned that the springboard cantilever sections do sway slightly (which unnerved my 7yr old)! The Fly really does give kids a chance to check out life in the tree tops, and see the rainforest from a new perspective.<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/treetop-boy2.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-6485 aligncenter" alt="treetop boy2" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/treetop-boy2-682x1024.jpeg" width="483" height="725" /></a></p>
<p>Things to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birds &#8211; some colourful species we saw included <a href="http://birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthorhynchus-tenuirostris">Eastern Spinebills</a>, <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Malurus-lamberti">Variegated Fairy-wrens</a>, and <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Eopsaltria-australis">Eastern Yellow Robins</a>. We even glimpsed a <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Menura-novaehollandiae">Superb Lyrebird</a> on the way home!</li>
<li>Tree hollows &#8211; how many can you count from the tree top walk? What might live there?</li>
<li>Wombat home &#8211; can you find the wombat crossing? Wombat hollow? Wombat letterbox?!</li>
<li>Steps &#8211; how many steps can you count on the way up to Knight&#8217;s Tower?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/knights-tower.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-6488 aligncenter" alt="knights tower" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/knights-tower-682x1024.jpeg" width="483" height="725" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/">Illawarra Fly</a> has great facilities for families, including cafe with indoor and outdoor seating, picnic tables, and clean toilets. Book online for best value tickets. The kids holiday program, <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/specials/ifly-4-kids/">iFly 4 Kids</a> (which includes entry to The Fly) does sell out quickly, so book early for the Christmas holidays!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have bamboo in our backyard that goes wild after good rain. Out of nowhere the spears shoot up, rising way past the top of our 6ft fence, before sprouting leaves.

<p>Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>To make our panflute we first stripped the bamboo of leaves and cut sections of bamboo, which the kids ordered according to length. We wrapped string around the first section, joining it to the second, then the third, and so on. This was a bit fiddly. We then wrapped string around all of the five sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, we wrapped in between each section. This helped to pull it all together tightly. We trimmed all of the ends and left them hanging at one side. Traditionally these were often plaited decoratively, or used to create a neck strap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As you can see from the photos, our panflute is fairly rudimentary! We could have sanded the cut sections of bamboo, we could have sealed the ends with wax, we could have used a crossbar&#8230; If you want to try a more authentic method, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-4-easy-Bamboo-Flutes-for-free/step4/Bamboo-Flute-Panflute/">instructables</a> have a 50+ step DIY guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>For us, the fun of this activity was in making something from nothing. We created a real musical instrument with string, secateurs, and a plant from the backyard. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6269" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">What could you and your kids create in the backyard together&#8230;?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about free play: it requires very, very little. <strong>Children who are good at free play know how to make their own fun.</strong> They don&#8217;t need an adult to provide them with toys. They don&#8217;t need an adult to outline the rules. They don&#8217;t need an adult to explain the process. They don&#8217;t need an adult at all really! Free play can happen any time, any where, with whatever is around.<span id="more-6191"></span></p>
<p>My favourite memory from our recent trip to Far North Queensland was an afternoon spent on the beach at Cape Tribulation. Cape Trib is across the Daintree River by barge, as far north as you can drive in a regular vehicle. It&#8217;s literally the end of the road, though it feels more like the edge of the world. So beautiful.</p>
<p>With no toys and no plans, the kids enjoyed an afternoon of free play with only the things they found on the beach. Here&#8217;s what they did:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6194" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have talked a lot about life and death in our home over the last week.  It&#8217;s a heavy topic, but circumstances meant discussing death was unavoidable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6026" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing that happened was that a young mum from our church passed away.  The kids understandably had some questions&#8230;<span id="more-5996"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mummy why are you sad?</li>
<li>What is a funeral?</li>
<li>What happens when people die?</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>I&#8217;m crying because a very sad thing happened -everybody cries sometimes.  A funeral is like a special church service where thank God for someone&#8217;s life, and celebrate what was wonderful about them even though we are sad.  And I believe that when we die, those who have accepted Jesus live forever with Him. </em></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6022" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The second thing that happened was that two of our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finch-love/">Gouldian Finch</a> eggs hatched.  The pair had been sitting on four tiny eggs.  Unfortunately a common behaviour of Gouldians is to &#8220;pitch&#8221; their young.  For a range of reasons, the parents toss their own chicks out of the nest.  Sadly our finches pitched their two chicks, and despite our attempts to return them to the nest, we were unable to save them.  The other two eggs did not hatch.  Again, the kids had questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did they throw their babies?</li>
<li>Why didn&#8217;t the other eggs hatch?</li>
<li>Should we bury them?</li>
<li>Why is nature so unfair?</li>
<li>Why do some creatures live and some die?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It is unfair, isn&#8217;t it? Sometimes Gouldians pitch their young because the chicks aren&#8217;t healthy, and sometimes because they just aren&#8217;t ready to be parents yet.  (Aren&#8217;t you glad I&#8217;m not a Mummy Finch?! I would never pitch you.)  I don&#8217;t know why the other two eggs didn&#8217;t hatch. Perhaps they didn&#8217;t grow properly inside, or maybe the parents didn&#8217;t keep them warm enough.  It&#8217;s hard to understand, but it&#8217;s important to remember that everything that lives &#8211; dies one day.  Yes, we can bury them together.  Let&#8217;s dig a little hole&#8230; </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6029" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>And thirdly, this weekend is Easter.  Today is Good Friday, the day we reflect on Jesus&#8217; death on the cross.  Sunday is coming, the day we celebrate His resurrection.  And the kids have questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why isn&#8217;t it called Bad Friday?</li>
<li>Why did Jesus die?</li>
<li>When can we have Easter eggs?!</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It does seem like a funny name because bad stuff happened and it was really sad when Jesus died on the cross.  But we call it Good Friday because it was good that Jesus came, good that He did all the things God sent Him to do, and good because the job was finished on the cross.  Jesus died for us so that we can all have new life.  Today we eat hot cross buns to remind us of the cross, and on Sunday, we&#8217;ll eat Easter eggs because eggs remind us of new life!</em></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/identifying-birds-eggs/">keen birdwatcher</a>, Miss 5 knows the scientific names of a few of her favourite species.  The first one she learned was <em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em> &#8211; the scientific name for a Rainbow Lorikeet.  The second was the closely related <em>Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus</em>, or Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.  From this early introduction to scientific names, my daughter discovered that:<span id="more-6001"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>all living things have a common name and scientific name</li>
<li>every different type of living thing has its own special scientific name</li>
<li>scientific names have two words (usually)</li>
<li>scientific names have funny words that sound different to every-day words</li>
<li>animals that are similar might have similar names (eg: first word the same, second word different)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this week, when we discovered an unusual species of fungi in the yard, I asked the kids this question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were the first scientist to discover this amazing species, what would you call it?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I know &#8211; weird, right?!  We discussed its unusual shape, vibrant colour, pungent smell, and &#8220;tentacles&#8221; while thinking of a name.  Miss 5 said the first word should be <em>Fungus </em>(based on her understanding of scientific names).  Maybe <em>Fungus Octopus</em>? What about<em> Fungus Redstar </em>or<em> Fungus Crazy?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em></em>And then&#8230; the game was on!  Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for other fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are the, ahem, un-scientific names of species as decided by the SquiggleKids:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Orangey</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6004" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Rosy </em>(named and written by Mr 3)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Goldiae</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Umbrellus</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids ran with this activity because it was of interest to them.  (Not all kids would find fungi so fascinating!)  Even my three year old wanted to &#8220;write&#8221; his own sign, and I loved seeing his purposeful scribble.  This kind of scribble is early writing at its finest.  I especially liked my daughter&#8217;s <em>Fungus Umbrellus</em>.  We discussed how the word <em>umbrella</em> sounded like an everyday word, but <em>umbrellus</em> sounded like a &#8220;science&#8221; word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both kids were so proud of their efforts too, and couldn&#8217;t wait to show SquiggleDad their discoveries. I think I have a couple of young naturalists on my hands!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: MUM! You have to see this. It&#8217;s weird. And cool. <em>M-U-M</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5934" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think that&#8217;s a cicada nymph.  Can you see the shell underneath? We sometimes find empty cicada shells, don&#8217;t we? It looks like this little guy didn&#8217;t quite make it out.  <span id="more-5933"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5935" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>A few minutes later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Mum, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s dead after all. He&#8217;s moving!</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Me: You&#8217;re right! He&#8217;s pulling himself up to the tree now, and I think those wings are getting bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5937" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Now his whole body has come out of the shell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Wow, look how his abdomen curls out like that. It really IS weird and cool. You were right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I know.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5938" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Whoa! Check out his wings!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Are they growing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: No, I think they are just getting bigger as they are drying out. See how they are wrinkly and curled up? I think they need to be all smooth before he can fly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">Butterflies</a> have to wait for their wings to dry before they can fly too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Good thinking. I wonder if all flying insects have to wait for their wings to dry&#8230;?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5939" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Do you think his wings are ready now Mum?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I don&#8217;t know. I guess we&#8217;ll have to keep watching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5940" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: He&#8217;s crawling away from his shell now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Maybe he&#8217;s not quite ready for flying yet&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mr 3: I can get him and &#8220;fly&#8221; him for you if you like</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5 and Me: <strong>NO!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5943" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="398" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>An hour later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Dinner time kids. Time to come inside now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: But I want to see him fly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5942" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Let&#8217;s take one last photo before the sun sets. Can you see how his wings are much closer to his body now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Before they were out flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think he will stay there now until it&#8217;s dark, and fly away in the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5941" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I&#8217;ll check if he&#8217;s gone in the morning&#8230;</p>

<p style="text-align: left">If you have a child who is into bugs, you might like to watch the following 5min documentary snippet from Sir David Attenborough about the life cycle of cicadas in America.  (Stop it at the 4min mark if you aren&#8217;t ready to explain what the male and female adult insects are doing together&#8230;)  In Australia, our cicadas don&#8217;t emerge on mass the same way &#8211; but they are still pretty noisy!</p>
