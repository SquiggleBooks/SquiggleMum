				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pwk-leaderboard-480X60.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pwk-leaderboard-480X60.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="60" /></a></p>
<p>I often describe my life  as organised chaos. I&#8217;m a too-busy mama with too many to-do lists and not enough hours in the day!  Sometimes the result is a big, full, happy, satisfying week.  At other times though, the result is a frazzled mother, cranky kids and a messy home.  I&#8217;m always inspired by other women who are still busy, yet manage to calm the chaos.<span id="more-5042"></span> Nicole Avery is one of those women.  She is a spreadsheet queen, mum of five,well known blogger and now author! Yes, the <a href="http://planningwithkids.com">Planning With Kids</a> blog is now a book.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Planning-with-Kids-Front-Cover-500-x-754.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5262" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Planning-with-Kids-Front-Cover-500-x-754.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>The book  is full of advice, suggestions, and tried-and-true ideas.  In addition to her own thoughts, Nicole has included quotes from mums and mummy-bloggers all over the country. Yours truly is featured in Part I (p4) in the chapter on <strong>Routines </strong>and their importance in family life.  I am NOT, however, offering any advice in the following chapters meal planning, or spreadsheeting your family finances!</p>
<p>Part II contains great common-sense advice for babies, toddlers, preschoolers and school aged children. I enjoyed reading this section and found myself nodding along much of the way.  I also picked up some wonderful tips from Nicole, and from the other quoted mums with children a little older than mine. There is always something we can learn from those who have gone before us.</p>
<p>Part III is about prioritising yourself, and your relationship with your husband (or partner).  Nic sets ten personal goals for herself every year, and holds herself accountable to them too! She also makes time each week to go to the gym, spend time blogging, and even schedules a Sunday sleep in.  She also has some really worthwhile advice to share about keeping your marriage strong while raising kids.  Part IV is all about family fun!  <strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Nicole-Avery-Planning-Queen-200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5264 alignright" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Nicole-Avery-Planning-Queen-200.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="160" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>This Friday, 10th June, Nicole is flying up from Melbourne to my sunny home town of Brisbane. She will be appearing at Westfield Chermside, 10am at Dymocks, to sign copies of her book. </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I know she would love to meet lots of her Brissy readers and it would be great to see you there.  We won&#8217;t be hard to find. She&#8217;ll be the one sitting at an organised desk with copies of her book, spare pens, bloggy business cards in one pocket and bandaids in the other. I&#8217;ll be the one beside her with frazzled hair&#8230;</p>
