				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you don&#8217;t live in Brisbane&#8217;s northern suburbs, and in case you missed the pics on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum" target="_blank">facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum" target="_blank">twitter</a>&#8230; yes, my kids were on the front page of the local paper.  I might be slightly biased but I think it&#8217;s a great photo.  Not just because they&#8217;re both smiling and looking at the camera, but because they are swinging from a rope ladder in our backyard.</p>
<p><span id="more-5844"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-frnt-page.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5845" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-frnt-page.png" alt="" width="600" height="478" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I love the headline too: <em>Swing back to good old fun</em>.  Couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself!  Even after receiving lots of lovely new things for Christmas, my kids are still happiest when they are monkeying around freely in the backyard.  This $12 rope ladder has provided hours of priceless fun and is still going strong after a year outside!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The front page pic is accompanied by a story and photo on page 5 about playscapes.  In the article, Rebekah Hurworth from <a href="http://yourarchitect.com.au/" target="_blank">Your Architect</a> says, &#8220;<em>&#8230; by incorporating sandpits, rockpools, cubby houses, reading areas and outdoor kitchen areas, children can spend hours entertaining themselves outside.</em>&#8221;  If you are interested in natural playscapes, you might also like to read this great pdf <a href="http://www.kidsafensw.org/docs/factsheets/PAU/Natural%20Playspaces%20KL%202011.pdf">fact sheet from Kidsafe</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-pg5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5846" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-pg5.png" alt="" width="501" height="457" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">You can see our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/backyard-sand-play/">sandpit</a>, the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">dry creek bed</a> and one of the bridges in the background, plus a bucket hanging from a pulley under the trees.  Our playscape is ever changing and growing, and always has something to offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>What do your kids do in the backyard?  And what did YOU do outside as a kid??</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PS &#8211; Yes, my kids usually have hats on outside <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PPS &#8211; Yes, the architect is also my little sister <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know that saying, &#8220;One person&#8217;s trash is another person&#8217;s treasure&#8230;&#8221;?!  Never has it been more true.<span id="more-5721"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5722" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I have been scouring second hand shops and sites for a while now, hoping to find a small sink for our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">much-loved dirt kitchen</a>.  So, I was completely delighted to come across this discarded laundry tub recently.  I hadn&#8217;t considered a laundry tub, but the deep single trough is perfect for outdoor <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/water-play/">water play</a>.  I also love the green colour which blends in fantastically with the dirt kitchen and surrounding trees.  (The kids&#8217; needs come first in our playscape, but I&#8217;ll admit I still prefer the back yard not to be an eyesore!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I thought about building a simple wooden structure to support the sink, but the kids were desperate to start using it so I propped it up on some bricks.  I made sure there was enough clearance underneath for the drain to flow freely, and the kids dug their own channel for the water to run out into the yard.  As it turned out, this has worked perfectly &#8211; so the bricks are staying for now!  The sink is tucked away beside the existing dirt kitchen, nestled between the trunks of a few big trees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I&#8217;m pleased to report that the grand total for this project was only a couple of dollars.  Yep, the cost of a plug.  I could have spent a hundred dollars on a fancy plastic water table, but I doubt my munchkins would have any more fun with it than they do with this tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5723" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Please don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking you need to spend big dollars on your children.  Keep your eye out for &#8220;treasures&#8221; and just let your kids be kids outside.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An outdoor chalkboard is another project I have had on my to-do list for a while. I love the idea of children having lots of writing and drawing opportunities outdoors.  I often find that writing naturally flows outside without the pressure of a classroom environment or the constraints of A4 paper.  Chalk is inviting too, because of its non-permanent nature and its accessibility for little hands. (<em>In fact, Mr 2 drew his first &#8220;people&#8221; pictures on the chalk board! See bottom left picture.</em>)<span id="more-5569"></span></p>
<p>Since adding <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">basket storage to our fences</a>, I have seen the potential in using fences to enhance the playspace rather than merely marking the garden&#8217;s boundaries.  So, we attached the large blackboard directly to the fence!  I also made a couple of extra smaller blackboards which can be moved around and used as needed.  One is a menu board in the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>, the other is waiting for playful inspiration&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboards.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5570" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboards.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="454" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Purchasing large chalk boards can be expensive. Making them yourself isn&#8217;t!  We bought marine ply for our boards so that they would withstand the outdoor conditions.  The cost was less than $15.  We then gave the plywood two coats of chalkboard paint.  The paint was under $20 and we still have a LOT left over for future projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Oh, and an old teacher-tip for you: <strong>to make chalk drawings semi-permanent, soak the chalk in a strong solution of sugar and water before using</strong>.  I drew the leaves in a corner of the large board, and the word <em>Menu </em>on one of the smaller boards in sugar-soaked chalk.  The kids can rub over them, and they won&#8217;t rub off!  This trick lasts a long time inside, but a good soaking rain will still wash it away outside.  (We used to do this to draw the blue-and-white handwriting lines on the classroom blackboards to save ruling them up every day).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboard-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5572" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboard-sq.jpg" alt="outdoor play blackboard chalk board " width="420" height="420" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">What do you think? Anyone else want to try this easy project?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have long had the idea of putting an actual letterbox in the backyard for the kids to use.  FINALLY I got around to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5443" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Letter writing is such a great, purposeful literacy activity.  It provides a reason to write, and an incentive to write <em><strong>well </strong></em>because you want the recipient to be able to read their letter when they receive it!</p>
<p>I picked up this letterbox from our local (big green) hardware store for around $12.  It&#8217;s nothing fancy, but it does the job perfectly and we don&#8217;t need to worry about it being able to withstand the conditions outside.  We simply screwed it to a low, existing sleeper wall beside the dirt kitchen.</p>
<p>It has already been more than worth the money!  The kids have written so many letters to each other, to Mummy and Daddy, and to friends who have come over to play.  Writing them is fun, reading them is fun, checking the mailbox is fun, and delivering the mail is fun. Of course, everyone participates at their own level.  Miss 5 has been doing some great early writing, using her sound-letter knowledge to have-a-go at writing independently.  She has also worked hard to decode the simple letters I have posted to her.  Mr 2 has enjoyed being the mailman, and posted some excellent scribbles to his sister!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox-coll.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5444" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox-coll.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="484" /></a></p>
<p>If you are looking for an inexpensive, non-permanent, interactive addition for your backyard or playspace&#8230; try a letterbox!  It provides a lovely way for siblings or parent-child to communicate, promotes early reading and writing, and gets kids outside. Ticks all my boxes <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year I am working hard to improve our backyard, and create a playscape rich in natural opportunities for learning, discovering, playing and growing.</p>
<p>When we added our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/getting-dirty-in-outdoor-kitchens/">Dirt Kitchen</a> to the backyard last year, you might remember that I started training a vine into a roof of sorts.  Here&#8217;s an image of it in August, 2010:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_vine_Aug10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4608" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_vine_Aug10.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>It was growing so well that it began to weigh the strings down, so I started thinking about ways to prop it up. Then wandering the aisles at <a href="http://www.bunnings.com.au/default.aspx">Bunnings</a> (as you do&#8230;) I found this arch for under $10.  I figured it was worth a try, and it turns out it was perfect for the job. I didn&#8217;t want it to be the full height, so I just left a few pieces off.  Then I went back to Bunnings and bought a second one!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_vine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4610" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_vine.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Look at it now!! With all the rain we&#8217;ve had in Brisbane, most plants have seen rapid growth.  Instead of just a roof, now we have a whole nature cubby growing.  Every day we see new growth, and the kids and I are enjoying winding the tendrils around the arches to create our walls and roof.  That &#8220;<a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/getting-dirty-in-outdoor-kitchens/">shady space</a>&#8221; I said I was dreaming of back in August is looking like a reality &#8211; and all for the grand sum of $20. Bargain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_collage2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4611" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_collage2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Stay tuned for more posts about our nature cubby, this interesting vine, and the creatures that are making this cubby house their home.</p>
