				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2014 feels like a new chapter for me. With both children at school full time, this year marks a new phase of life with lots of new beginnings.<span id="more-6620"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hello-New-Year.png"><img class="wp-image-6627 aligncenter" alt="Hello New Year" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hello-New-Year.png" width="574" height="430" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>New Home.</strong>  The SOLD sign is up! We have purchased a house here in &#8220;The Shire&#8221; and are looking forward to putting our stamp on it. Sydney is our home now. <em>(Must buy new homewares.)</em></li>
<li><strong>New Job.  </strong>I am delighted to have been offered a part-time position working in Gifted and Talented Education. I will be working to extend students from a range of ages across various subject areas. <em>(Must buy new shoes.)</em></li>
<li><strong>New Study.</strong> Oh, and did I mention I&#8217;m going back to uni?! I am very excited about studying my Masters degree in Children&#8217;s Literature at Macquarie University, part time. <em>(Must buy new stationery.)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I think all of that should keep me busy, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I will still be blogging here, about mothering, teaching and writing. Five years ago when I began the blogging journey, I wrote largely about my own children and their early experiences. Now that they are older, I feel their stories are their own to share. I will still write about them occasionally (with their permission), but you will see more general educational posts, more book reviews, and perhaps even some more creative writing from me.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing 2014 with you. You can also stay in touch with me on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum">facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum">twitter</a> or <a href="http://pinterest.com/squigglemum">pinterest</a> if you&#8217;re interested. Happy New Year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word &#8220;home&#8221; has been on my mind a lot these past few weeks. What is home?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Home-wifi-squigglemum.png"><img class="wp-image-6468 aligncenter" alt="Home wifi squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Home-wifi-squigglemum-682x1024.png" width="434" height="653" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Home is a roof overhead</strong>. At least in the short term, <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/mums/hello-sydney/">&#8220;home&#8221; for us in Sydney</a> is a rental house. To be honest I feel unsettled living in a rented property. The house is lovely, and I am so grateful for it, but making it feel like it&#8217;s <em><strong>ours</strong></em> is challenging. <span id="more-6467"></span>No repainting feature walls, or hanging pictures where ever I like, and certainly no demolition of any kind! What I can do though is surround us with familiarity. I can put familiar faces on the fridge, I can put familiar cushions on the couch, and I can bake familiar things in the oven. (Actually, I haven&#8217;t quite worked out my oven here yet&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Home is where ever we&#8217;re together</strong>. Cliched, I know. It&#8217;s funny how true it is though when you relocate a family. There are <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/activities/goodbye-brisbane/">things I miss about Brisbane</a>, but I&#8217;m not &#8220;homesick&#8221; because we&#8217;re here together. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">At the end of the day, it&#8217;s the togetherness that matters most. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">And the things that I do miss aren&#8217;t things anyway &#8211; they are people. I have wonderful friends in Brissy, and around the world, who will still be my friends no matter how far apart we are. A big move gives you a real perspective shift. </span></p>
<p><strong>Home is eternal</strong>. As a Christian, I also believe I have a forever-home in heaven and I need to remind myself that nothing here on earth is permanent. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">As I wrestle with the question of what home is, t</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">he unsettled feeling in my soul is probably good for me. My eyes should be fixed on something far greater than a nice house and a nice life. </span></p>
<p><strong>So what is home for you? Home is&#8230; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; while I&#8217;m on the topic of home, you might notice that my blog-home has been given a makeover too! It&#8217;s a cleaner, simpler design that is mobile friendly. Hope you like. Cath x</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><em>New state, new city, new suburb.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>New house, new yard, new neighbourhood.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>New school, new church, new shopping centre.<span id="more-6310"></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/garie-beach.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6315" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/garie-beach.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Garie Beach, <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Royal-National-Park">Royal National Park</a>, NSW)</p>
<p>New things are exciting, but also a little unsettling. And when almost everything in your world is new, life can be very unsettled. I&#8217;m discovering that both holding on to the old, and embracing the new, are important elements in establishing life in a new place. Here are some things I&#8217;ve been doing to help my kids with the transition:</p>
<p>1.  Holding on to the old:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beds</strong>. Same beds, same sheets, same pjs. There&#8217;s something incredibly normalising about sleeping in your own bed.</li>
<li><strong>Routine</strong>. The same morning <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/routine-charts-for-easy-starts/">routine</a> chart that was on the fridge in Brisbane, is still on the fridge in Sydney. It&#8217;s business as usual on school mornings&#8230; make bed, uniform on, breakfast, teeth brushing, hair done, unstack dishwasher, pack bag. The uniforms might be different, but nothing else has changed there.</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>. Holding on to special friendships is important. Miss 7 has put framed photographs of her friends in pride of place in her bedroom. She has also sent a few text messages on my phone, and started some letter writing.</li>
</ul>
<div>2.  Embracing the new:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outdoor play</strong>. Our new yard is very different from the backyard the kids knew and loved in <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/goodbye-brisbane/">Brisbane</a>. For the first time ever, we have a flat patch of grass &#8211; so we bought a trampoline! Some serious jumping is great for warming up chilly little bodies who are used to a warmer climate.</li>
<li><strong>Exploring</strong>. Sydney is a beautiful part of the world. The city is big and busy, but away from the traffic there are rivers, bays, beaches and bushland to explore. While our family has some space from weekend commitments and after school activities, we are happily exploring <a href="http://www.sutherlandshireaustralia.com.au/">Sutherland Shire</a> where we now call home. (Pic above is in nearby <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Royal-National-Park">Royal National Park</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>. &#8220;Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, the other gold.&#8221; Making new friends is important in feeling like you belong in a place. As I encourage the kids to introduce themselves to other children, I am also endeavouring to lead by example and be proactive about meeting other mums myself.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Moving interstate with a young family is a big deal. It&#8217;s early days yet, but so far so good&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again blogging has taken a back seat to real life, as we farewell our hometown of Brisbane. Relocating a family is a huge undertaking! We have spent the last few weeks in a whirlwind of cleaning, clearing, decluttering, and <a href="http://gumtree.com.au">gumtree</a>-ing in order to sell our home. At the same time, we&#8217;ve also been flying down to Sydney to find a suburb that will work for our family, and then lining up new home and school. Oh, and in between, catching up &#8220;just one more time&#8221; with all of our beautiful friends here in Brisbane.<span id="more-6297"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to our home. We moved here as new parents with a baby girl, and the house needed a LOT of work. Over the past seven years we have slowly but surely renovated it to suit our style and our growing family. Look at it now!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6298" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The backyard has also seen more than a few changes, and so many of them have featured here on the blog.</p>
<ul>
<li>We  created our own <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">dry creek bed</a>.</li>
<li>We built a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/backyard-letterbox/">post box</a>.</li>
<li>We installed huge <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/outdoor-chalk-boards/">chalk boards</a>.</li>
<li>We added <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">toy storage</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">climbed trees</a>. And <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">fell out of them</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/our-rope-ladder/">rope ladder</a>.</li>
<li>We created a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/garden-in-a-week/">veggie garden</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kids have really grown up in this back yard! Together we have explored</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">frogs</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">butterflies</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/watching-nature-unfold-cicada/">cicadas</a>, and other <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bug-hunt/">insects</a></li>
<li>Plant life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/seedpods/">seedpods</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/fantastic-fungus/">fungi</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/scientific-literacy/">more fungi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am so glad I have these posts as a record of our outdoor adventures in their pre-school years. Now at 7 and 4, the kids are getting older and their needs in our new backyard will be different &#8211; but I know these early experiences will impact on the way they play. They know how to <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/sticks-and-stones/">make their own fun</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/the-big-branch/">solve problems together</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bamboo-panflutes/">be creative</a> outdoors.</p>
<p>I am sad to say goodbye to this home, but grateful for all the learning and growing that has happened here. And I am ready for what is next&#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about free play: it requires very, very little. <strong>Children who are good at free play know how to make their own fun.</strong> They don&#8217;t need an adult to provide them with toys. They don&#8217;t need an adult to outline the rules. They don&#8217;t need an adult to explain the process. They don&#8217;t need an adult at all really! Free play can happen any time, any where, with whatever is around.<span id="more-6191"></span></p>
<p>My favourite memory from our recent trip to Far North Queensland was an afternoon spent on the beach at Cape Tribulation. Cape Trib is across the Daintree River by barge, as far north as you can drive in a regular vehicle. It&#8217;s literally the end of the road, though it feels more like the edge of the world. So beautiful.</p>
<p>With no toys and no plans, the kids enjoyed an afternoon of free play with only the things they found on the beach. Here&#8217;s what they did:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6194" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have previously shared some thoughts about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">children and risk</a>, both here on the blog and <a href="http://96five.com">on air</a>. And when my daughter knocked herself out by <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">falling while tree climbing</a> &#8211; my opinion was challenged, but ultimately unchanged.</p>
<p>While I am happy to share my perspective as an educator and a mother, I am not a child psychologist myself, so I was delighted to be able to interview <a href="http://www.pathwayshrc.com.au/about-us/professor-paula-barrett/">Dr Paula Barrett</a> about this topic.  Here are her thoughts on the risky business of childhood.<span id="more-6139"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6142" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Yes, my kids are playing with sticks&#8230;!)</p>
<p><strong>Paula, why is it important for children to be allowed to take risks in their play?</strong></p>
<p>There are several reasons but mainly because children learn and gain resilience through challenging experiences. If a child only ever does things within their comfort zone, where they completely understand all the potential outcomes, they don’t learn how to deal with not always achieving the right result or potential disappointment, which is extremely important in later life. Children learn the most when they are challenged.</p>
<p><strong>As parents, how do we know what is reasonable risk, and what is dangerous? </strong></p>
<p>Risk needs to be determined dependant on the particular child and what is developmentally appropriate. For example, a very young child may be able to climb a tree but doesn’t actually yet have the muscle strength for a successful climb – which can result in a dangerous situation. It is very useful to listen to your support networks to help guide you on this, such as grandparents who have great experience and parents with kids of a similar age as they may have dealt with similar situations.  There are also other networks you can rely on who have studied in this area, for example, child care workers, sport coaches etc – they can often make a valuable contribution to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Have today&#8217;s parents become too risk averse?  Why do you think this has happened?</strong></p>
<p>There are so many reasons for this but I think the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents are more isolated when bringing up children than they used to be. Involving your support networks can help you better evaluate risk by including those with experience, like grandparents or parents with kids of similar ages.</li>
<li>There are just so many rules – which are good in that they protect society at large however they can also inhibit children to take risk.</li>
<li>Kids time today is increasingly over-structured with too many scheduled activities &#8211; which minimises the opportunities children to be challenged outside of being told what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should we do to encourage children who are not natural risk takers?</strong></p>
<p>A great way to encourage children who are not natural risk takers is to help them form friendships with children who are.</p>
<p>And, as parents you can reassure them through modelling the behaviour– go outside with them and get involved.  You can try a step plan where you encourage them to face challenging situations in small steps – maybe once a week or once a fortnight, only moving them to the next step when they are ready.  It helps to reward them but not with things that you buy – it is more powerful to dedicate time to something that they love doing e.g. take them to the beach or build a cubby house with them.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any evidence to suggest that encouraging kids to take risks in play might lead to risky behaviour later in life? </strong></p>
<p>No, there is none at all! Children taking risks during play build self-confidence, whereas developing good judgement or self-regulation is another issue all together. Risk taking in adulthood is more about personality and life choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> _______________________________</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After church my six year old asked the question &#8211; &#8220;Mum, what does three in one mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>I took a deep breath before launching into my answer.  Despite the fact that I&#8217;ve been a Christian for most of my life, there are still some things I find hard to get my head around.  (There will probably always be things I can&#8217;t get my head around when it comes to God, because He&#8217;s God. And I&#8217;m not.)<span id="more-6102"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/three-rings.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6103" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/three-rings.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="358" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">So, as best I could I talked to her about God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  The Bible is clear that they are all God, three in one.  My daughter looked confused (understandably), so I talked some more, using the example of three interconnected rings, or a three strand rope.  She still looked puzzled, and I feared I was confusing her more than helping her.  After all, it is a concept hard to fully grasp myself as an adult.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Instead of trying to give her the answers I thought she wanted, I asked if she had any questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8220;Mum,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t asking about God. I was just wondering about that coffee stuff in the kitchen&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nescafe-box.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6104" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nescafe-box.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="194" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Note to self: </strong>don&#8217;t over think it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PS &#8211; this isn&#8217;t the Faith post I had planned for this month, but I had to share <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t laugh. I might be all tech savvy with my iPad and iPhone and MacBook &#8211; but I cannot live without a paper diary!  I&#8217;ve always opted for a small one that I can keep in my handbag, but when I started working part time a few weeks ago I knew I needed to graduate to something more substantial.<span id="more-6074"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/innerb-open.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6077" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/innerb-open.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Hellloooo <a href="http://www.inner-b.com/">Inner B</a>!  I jumped at the chance to try out their Mum Organiser*.  Here are 5 things I LOVE about it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s robust.</strong>  I give my things a pretty good workout, and this diary is in and out of my bag several times a day. It&#8217;s really well made, the binder is strong, and I&#8217;m confident it will go the distance!</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s refillable.</strong>  Next year&#8217;s diary will only set me back $16.95 which is the cost of the 2013 refills.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s pretty.</strong>  I know that sounds shallow, but a visually appealing diary does help me to approach daily tasks more positively.  The Mum Organiser comes in three fresh shades.  No cutesy cartoons or tacky taglines here. Just good design and happy colour.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s well thought out.</strong>  I really like the monthly dividers, and the monthly overview at the start of each section. I also appreciate the week to a double page layout.  I cope with my <span style="color: #000000"><del>insanely</del> <del>ridiculously</del></span> busy schedule much better when I can easily scan a month or a week at a time.   The business card pockets at the front are great, plus I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s space for a pen to permanently live in my diary.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s made for me.</strong>  Well, not me exactly&#8230; but it is made for mums, with special consideration for things mums tend to write in their diaries.  And it is made for those Down Under, with Australian and New Zealand school holidays and public holidays marked. (Yay!)</li>
</ol>
<p>The only small criticism I have for the <a href="http://www.inner-b.com/">Inner B Mum Organiser</a> is that it is a little tricky to write close to the binder rings &#8211; but then again, without the binder it wouldn&#8217;t be refillable.  All in all I think this is a great product, particularly for mums like me who juggle part time work with full time parenting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/InnerB-Mum-colours-1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-6078" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/InnerB-Mum-colours-1.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="441" /></a>To celebrate Mothers Day this weekend, I have one Mum Organiser to give away valued at $44.95 thanks to the amazing Valerie Petersen at Inner B.  All you have to do is leave a comment sharing why YOU need a Mummy Organiser!  </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I look like I&#8217;ve got life sorted.</p>
<p>But the truth is, most of the time, I&#8217;m not so together.<span id="more-6064"></span></p>
<p>The kids aren&#8217;t always happy. The bickies aren&#8217;t always home-baked. The floors aren&#8217;t always swept.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s highly likely I can&#8217;t find my keys, or my phone, or my shoes, or my brain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know that God doesn&#8217;t need me to be perfect.</p>
<p>In fact &#8211; He often uses my weaknesses more than my strengths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[5 outdoor activities using tin cans, plus win a MILO Play Kit]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very pleased to be an ambassador for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/miloausnz">MILO Play Movement</a> in 2012.  Play is a child&#8217;s work, and the importance of play in children&#8217;s development cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>MILO sent the SquiggleKids a fantastic play kit (final photo) to use in the backyard &#8211; and <strong>I&#8217;ve got one play kit to give away to a lucky SquiggleMum reader as well</strong>!  The kit contains soccer nets, cones, a selection of different balls and even a ball pump for your kids to use outside, plus a couple of tins of MILO.<span id="more-6036"></span></p>
<p>So of course, you know what my kids have had the most fun with, don&#8217;t you&#8230;?  <strong>The tins!!  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6041" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Kids have been inventing games with MILO tins for as long as MILO has been around. The labels might have changed, but not much else has. Here are 5 activities that are sure to bring back memories, and your own kids might like them too:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1.  Tin can stilts</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">2. Tin can telephone</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6043" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">3. Tin can bucket (on pulley rope)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6044" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">4. Tin can bowling</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6045" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">5. Tin can drums</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-drums.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6046" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-drums.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids have had SO much fun playing with a couple of tins. Sometimes I think commercial toys are entirely overrated.  That said, they were also pretty excited about this stuff:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6047" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
