				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging as SquiggleMum in 2008, with an eight week old baby in my arms and a toddler under my feet. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but with two school aged kids and a busy life offline &#8211; I&#8217;m finally ready to let go of SquiggleMum. Well, the mum part anyway. <span id="more-6843"></span></p>
<p>I rarely write about parenting these days, and I feel that stories of my children&#8217;s adventures (or misadventures as the case may be) aren&#8217;t for me to share anymore. So I&#8217;m making a new home online, at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">squigglebooks.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglebooks.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6844" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/squigglebooks-logo1.png" alt="squigglebooks logo1" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">SquiggleBooks</a> you&#8217;ll find a mix of book reviews, posts about children&#8217;s literacy, thoughts about education, and tips for teachers. You&#8217;ll also be able to keep up with the latest news about my own writing career, and definitely be among the first to know <del>if</del> when I land that elusive picture book contract. It&#8217;s a pretty basic site for now, but I expect it will grow and change just as this blog has.</p>
<p>Before I go, I&#8217;d like to thank a bunch of people who have been part of the SquiggleMum journey. There have been thousands of comments on the blog over the years &#8211; <em>thank you</em> to each of you who took time to connect here. Some readers have become friends &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for staying in touch and encouraging me along the way. I have been privileged to write for a number of other parenting sites and share parenting advice on air &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for having me.  I have also won several awards and been invited to speak about blogging at conferences &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for the opportunity. Thank you to the bloggers who have been with me since the beginning &#8211; especially Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a>, as well as Kate from <a href="http://picklebums.com">Picklebums</a>, and Kelly from <a href="http://beafunmum.com/">Be A Fun Mum</a>. (There are too many others to name!)</p>
<p>I hope that many of you will join me in this next chapter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Blessings,</h2>
<h2>Cath / SquiggleMum.</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I should start by saying &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6713" alt="peppa pig" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg" width="286" height="176" /></a></p>
<p>But poor Peppa has been under fire recently thanks to a <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00283/full">new study</a> into the effect of anthropomorphic picture books on children&#8217;s knowledge about animals. <span id="more-6712"></span>Anthropomorphism is the literary device by which we give human characteristics to non-human things, often animals. Anthropomorphism has long been in prevalent in children&#8217;s literature: <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> are excellent examples, and then of course there are all of Beatrix Potter&#8217;s sweet books. The study found that &#8220;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">anthropomorphized animals in books may not only lead to less learning but also influence children&#8217;s conceptual knowledge of animals.&#8221; This, of course, has upset Peppa Pig fans. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is nothing wrong with anthropomorphism (and as I said &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig), but I have to agree with the study. </strong></p>
<p>The problem comes when children&#8217;s primary (or only) source of information about animals is a fantastical, human-esque version. Peppa Pig is a lovely pig. But if a child&#8217;s only experience of a pig is Peppa, there are going to be obvious issues with the child&#8217;s conceptual understanding of pigs.</p>
<p>You see, the things I like about Peppa are NOT the things that make her a pig. Quite the contrary. The things I like about Peppa are the humanistic elements of her character. I like that she&#8217;s from a nice family. She plays with her brother. She is polite to her mum. She laughs with her dad. They spend time together. Mostly in muddy puddles. But apart from the mud, none of those things are piggish at all!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6715" alt="pig in mud" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>If you look at the picture books on your child&#8217;s bookshelf, you will probably find the same thing over and over again. <strong>How many books does your child have with animals behaving humanly? And how many with animals actually behaving like animals??</strong> As the study says, &#8220;If we want children to learn new things about animals, we need to expose them to stories that present the animals and their environments in a biologically realistic manner, both in the way that they are depicted and the way they are described.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this is worth serious consideration for parents, teachers, and publishers. <strong>We need more non-fiction. Beautiful, information rich, interesting, read-it-again nonfiction.</strong> Books about piglets, bunnies, and owls might deliver warm fuzzies  &#8211; but our kids deserve to also have books about pig farming, real rabbits and birds of prey. Without a balance of both, they will grow up with a skewed, human-centred perspective of the natural world.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2014 feels like a new chapter for me. With both children at school full time, this year marks a new phase of life with lots of new beginnings.<span id="more-6620"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hello-New-Year.png"><img class="wp-image-6627 aligncenter" alt="Hello New Year" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hello-New-Year.png" width="574" height="430" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>New Home.</strong>  The SOLD sign is up! We have purchased a house here in &#8220;The Shire&#8221; and are looking forward to putting our stamp on it. Sydney is our home now. <em>(Must buy new homewares.)</em></li>
<li><strong>New Job.  </strong>I am delighted to have been offered a part-time position working in Gifted and Talented Education. I will be working to extend students from a range of ages across various subject areas. <em>(Must buy new shoes.)</em></li>
<li><strong>New Study.</strong> Oh, and did I mention I&#8217;m going back to uni?! I am very excited about studying my Masters degree in Children&#8217;s Literature at Macquarie University, part time. <em>(Must buy new stationery.)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I think all of that should keep me busy, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I will still be blogging here, about mothering, teaching and writing. Five years ago when I began the blogging journey, I wrote largely about my own children and their early experiences. Now that they are older, I feel their stories are their own to share. I will still write about them occasionally (with their permission), but you will see more general educational posts, more book reviews, and perhaps even some more creative writing from me.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing 2014 with you. You can also stay in touch with me on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum">facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum">twitter</a> or <a href="http://pinterest.com/squigglemum">pinterest</a> if you&#8217;re interested. Happy New Year!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have bamboo in our backyard that goes wild after good rain. Out of nowhere the spears shoot up, rising way past the top of our 6ft fence, before sprouting leaves. It provides great screening, but often needs serious pruning! The kids have used the  pruned <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/outdoor-multi-age-play/">bamboo spears in their play </a>in the past. Recently we tried something new.<span id="more-6265"></span></p>
<p>Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>To make our panflute we first stripped the bamboo of leaves and cut sections of bamboo, which the kids ordered according to length. We wrapped string around the first section, joining it to the second, then the third, and so on. This was a bit fiddly. We then wrapped string around all of the five sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, we wrapped in between each section. This helped to pull it all together tightly. We trimmed all of the ends and left them hanging at one side. Traditionally these were often plaited decoratively, or used to create a neck strap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As you can see from the photos, our panflute is fairly rudimentary! We could have sanded the cut sections of bamboo, we could have sealed the ends with wax, we could have used a crossbar&#8230; If you want to try a more authentic method, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-4-easy-Bamboo-Flutes-for-free/step4/Bamboo-Flute-Panflute/">instructables</a> have a 50+ step DIY guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>For us, the fun of this activity was in making something from nothing. We created a real musical instrument with string, secateurs, and a plant from the backyard. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6269" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">What could you and your kids create in the backyard together&#8230;?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Text isn&#8217;t limited to words on a page. There is text all around us! Pre-readers are particularly aware of environmental print, and often it provides their first experiences of independent reading.<span id="more-6210"></span></p>
<p>On our holiday we saw lots of signs while driving around, including some that were new to us. Interpreting the road signs was a great early reading experience for the kids, especially for Mr4 who is still in the pre-reading phase.  Signs with added information provided a great reading opportunity for Miss6 as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/holiday-sign-jellyfish-yellow.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6217 aligncenter" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/holiday-sign-jellyfish-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="640" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signs written in multiple languages were even more fun to read, and allowed for great conversation about the purpose of the sign, how important the message was, and who the audience might be. This is the beginning of critical literacy. (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/doctorow/127405031/in/photostream/">image link</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/holiday-sign-croc-yellow.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6218" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/holiday-sign-croc-yellow.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="359" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">While we drove through the Daintree rainforest to Cape Tribulation, we were all on Cassowary watch. I so badly wanted to see a cassowary in the wild. Sadly, no matter how hard we looked &#8211; the only cassowaries we saw were the ones on the road signs. Mr4 pointed out every. single. one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">One cassowary sign is famous in these parts. The speed bump sign has had a little editing&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/holiday-signs-cassowary.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6221" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/holiday-signs-cassowary-680x1024.jpg" alt="" width="490" height="737" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">You can look for interesting signs with the kids anywhere, not just on holidays. Try asking some of these questions (depending on the age of your child):</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you seen any other signs that colour?</li>
<li>What could that symbol mean?</li>
<li>What number is that?</li>
<li>Why is that number on a sign?</li>
<li>Are there any letters from your name on the sign?</li>
<li>Is that a sign that you <em><strong>have</strong></em> to obey, or just a suggestion? How do you know?</li>
</ul>

		<description><![CDATA[Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/identifying-birds-eggs/">keen birdwatcher</a>, Miss 5 knows the scientific names of a few of her favourite species.  The first one she learned was <em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em> &#8211; the scientific name for a Rainbow Lorikeet.  The second was the closely related <em>Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus</em>, or Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.  From this early introduction to scientific names, my daughter discovered that:<span id="more-6001"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>all living things have a common name and scientific name</li>
<li>every different type of living thing has its own special scientific name</li>
<li>scientific names have two words (usually)</li>
<li>scientific names have funny words that sound different to every-day words</li>
<li>animals that are similar might have similar names (eg: first word the same, second word different)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this week, when we discovered an unusual species of fungi in the yard, I asked the kids this question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were the first scientist to discover this amazing species, what would you call it?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I know &#8211; weird, right?!  We discussed its unusual shape, vibrant colour, pungent smell, and &#8220;tentacles&#8221; while thinking of a name.  Miss 5 said the first word should be <em>Fungus </em>(based on her understanding of scientific names).  Maybe <em>Fungus Octopus</em>? What about<em> Fungus Redstar </em>or<em> Fungus Crazy?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em></em>And then&#8230; the game was on!  Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for other fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are the, ahem, un-scientific names of species as decided by the SquiggleKids:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Orangey</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6004" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Rosy </em>(named and written by Mr 3)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Goldiae</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Umbrellus</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids ran with this activity because it was of interest to them.  (Not all kids would find fungi so fascinating!)  Even my three year old wanted to &#8220;write&#8221; his own sign, and I loved seeing his purposeful scribble.  This kind of scribble is early writing at its finest.  I especially liked my daughter&#8217;s <em>Fungus Umbrellus</em>.  We discussed how the word <em>umbrella</em> sounded like an everyday word, but <em>umbrellus</em> sounded like a &#8220;science&#8221; word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both kids were so proud of their efforts too, and couldn&#8217;t wait to show SquiggleDad their discoveries. I think I have a couple of young naturalists on my hands!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The amazing life cycle of a cicada. We watched this cicada nymph emerge as an adult in our own backyard. Fascinating. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: MUM! You have to see this. It&#8217;s weird. And cool. <em>M-U-M</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5934" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think that&#8217;s a cicada nymph.  Can you see the shell underneath? We sometimes find empty cicada shells, don&#8217;t we? It looks like this little guy didn&#8217;t quite make it out.  <span id="more-5933"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5935" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>A few minutes later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Mum, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s dead after all. He&#8217;s moving!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5936" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: You&#8217;re right! He&#8217;s pulling himself up to the tree now, and I think those wings are getting bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5937" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Now his whole body has come out of the shell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Wow, look how his abdomen curls out like that. It really IS weird and cool. You were right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I know.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5938" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Whoa! Check out his wings!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Are they growing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: No, I think they are just getting bigger as they are drying out. See how they are wrinkly and curled up? I think they need to be all smooth before he can fly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">Butterflies</a> have to wait for their wings to dry before they can fly too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Good thinking. I wonder if all flying insects have to wait for their wings to dry&#8230;?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5939" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Do you think his wings are ready now Mum?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I don&#8217;t know. I guess we&#8217;ll have to keep watching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5940" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: He&#8217;s crawling away from his shell now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Maybe he&#8217;s not quite ready for flying yet&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mr 3: I can get him and &#8220;fly&#8221; him for you if you like</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5 and Me: <strong>NO!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5943" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="398" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>An hour later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Dinner time kids. Time to come inside now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: But I want to see him fly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5942" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Let&#8217;s take one last photo before the sun sets. Can you see how his wings are much closer to his body now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Before they were out flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think he will stay there now until it&#8217;s dark, and fly away in the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5941" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I&#8217;ll check if he&#8217;s gone in the morning&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you have a child who is into bugs, you might like to watch the following 5min documentary snippet from Sir David Attenborough about the life cycle of cicadas in America.  (Stop it at the 4min mark if you aren&#8217;t ready to explain what the male and female adult insects are doing together&#8230;)  In Australia, our cicadas don&#8217;t emerge on mass the same way &#8211; but they are still pretty noisy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My kids are energetic.  Very energetic.  I think most happy, healthy kids are &#8211; but it&#8217;s good to slow them down sometimes and help them to notice life&#8217;s little things.  One way we like to do this outside is to go on a bug hunt.  There are interesting insects and other small creatures all around, but often we don&#8217;t notice them because we are too busy.  Open your child&#8217;s eyes to the wonder of bugs!<span id="more-5707"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/red-bugs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5709" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/red-bugs.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="630" /></a></p>
<p>Although you can go on a bug hunt with nothing but a pair of eyes, kids often respond more enthusiastically when they have a few &#8220;tools&#8221; to use.  You might even like to make up a bug-kit for your child, with some of the following items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Magnifying glass &#8211; for looking up close. Even young kids enjoy the magic of magnification.</li>
<li>Camera or smart phone &#8211; our tech savvy kids are quite used to having Mum&#8217;s phone on hand to take photos of interesting things!  This is a good way to let them have a go at taking photos independently.</li>
<li>Notebook and pencil &#8211; older children may like to make a list (words or pictures) of the insects they find.</li>
<li>Tweezers &#8211; not for bugs!! These can be useful for gently lifting up leaves and bark from the ground to reveal creatures hidden underneath.  Great activity for developing fine motor skills too.</li>
<li>Bug catcher &#8211; Depending on what your kids find, they may want to put an insect into a bug catcher to observe more closely. Unless we are sure an insect is safe to touch, we put critters into the bug catcher by picking up the leaf or stick they are on, rather than picking up the bug.  I encourage my kids to release any creatures they have caught at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities like this also provide an opportunity for conversations about nature. Try asking some of these questions when your child discovers an interesting critter.  Remember that open ended questions require your child to think at a higher level, and create much richer discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Questions</strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stink_bugs.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5711 alignright" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stink_bugs.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="384" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>What colour is it?</li>
<li>How many legs does it have?</li>
<li>Where did you find it?</li>
<li>Is it bigger or smaller than your fingernail?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open Ended Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is it similar to any other bugs you have seen? In what way?</li>
<li>If you were a scientist in charge of naming this creature, what would you call it?</li>
<li>What do you think it eats? Why?</li>
<li>What do you think might eat IT?</li>
<li>Do you think the babies and adults of this bug look the same as each other, or different. Why do you think that?</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Happy hunting!</strong></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[We spent an entire afternoon outside in nature; exploring the leaf litter, collecting sticks, looking for shapes and thinking about numbers.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>&#8220;Mummy! Mum! Look what I found. It&#8217;s a number six leaf! Cooooool!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Such excitement over a simple leaf. She then dropped it, of course, and so we set off on a search for another 6-shaped-leaf.  I suggested we look for other numeral shapes as well.<span id="more-5615"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/nature-numbers-making.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5622" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/nature-numbers-making.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="272" /></a></p>
<p>Before long we were all engaged in a hunt for nature&#8217;s numbers.  I grabbed a long piece of cardboard for our collection, and we attached each numeral with sticky tape.  Because we didn&#8217;t always find numbers in the right order, it was a challenge for Miss 5 to stick them down in the right place, while still leaving enough room for other numerals as we discovered them.</p>
<p>We spent an entire afternoon outside in nature; exploring the leaf litter, collecting sticks, looking for shapes and thinking about numbers.  <strong>What a delightful way to learn together.</strong></p>
<p>When I look back at my classroom teaching days, I wonder how many activities like this I could have taken OUTSIDE&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/nature-numbers-holding.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5623" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/nature-numbers-holding.jpg" alt="numerals numbers nature leaves" width="600" height="279" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">(My daughter took her nature numbers to show at school</p>
<p style="text-align: center">and they are now proudly hanging in her classroom.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have long had the idea of putting an actual letterbox in the backyard for the kids to use.  FINALLY I got around to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5443" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Letter writing is such a great, purposeful literacy activity.  It provides a reason to write, and an incentive to write <em><strong>well </strong></em>because you want the recipient to be able to read their letter when they receive it!</p>
<p>I picked up this letterbox from our local (big green) hardware store for around $12.  It&#8217;s nothing fancy, but it does the job perfectly and we don&#8217;t need to worry about it being able to withstand the conditions outside.  We simply screwed it to a low, existing sleeper wall beside the dirt kitchen.</p>
<p>It has already been more than worth the money!  The kids have written so many letters to each other, to Mummy and Daddy, and to friends who have come over to play.  Writing them is fun, reading them is fun, checking the mailbox is fun, and delivering the mail is fun. Of course, everyone participates at their own level.  Miss 5 has been doing some great early writing, using her sound-letter knowledge to have-a-go at writing independently.  She has also worked hard to decode the simple letters I have posted to her.  Mr 2 has enjoyed being the mailman, and posted some excellent scribbles to his sister!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox-coll.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5444" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox-coll.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="484" /></a></p>
<p>If you are looking for an inexpensive, non-permanent, interactive addition for your backyard or playspace&#8230; try a letterbox!  It provides a lovely way for siblings or parent-child to communicate, promotes early reading and writing, and gets kids outside. Ticks all my boxes <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
