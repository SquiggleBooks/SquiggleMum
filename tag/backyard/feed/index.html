				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again blogging has taken a back seat to real life, as we farewell our hometown of Brisbane. Relocating a family is a huge undertaking! We have spent the last few weeks in a whirlwind of cleaning, clearing, decluttering, and <a href="http://gumtree.com.au">gumtree</a>-ing in order to sell our home. At the same time, we&#8217;ve also been flying down to Sydney to find a suburb that will work for our family, and then lining up new home and school. Oh, and in between, catching up &#8220;just one more time&#8221; with all of our beautiful friends here in Brisbane.<span id="more-6297"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to our home. We moved here as new parents with a baby girl, and the house needed a LOT of work. Over the past seven years we have slowly but surely renovated it to suit our style and our growing family. Look at it now!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6298" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The backyard has also seen more than a few changes, and so many of them have featured here on the blog.</p>
<ul>
<li>We  created our own <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">dry creek bed</a>.</li>
<li>We built a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/backyard-letterbox/">post box</a>.</li>
<li>We installed huge <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/outdoor-chalk-boards/">chalk boards</a>.</li>
<li>We added <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">toy storage</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">climbed trees</a>. And <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">fell out of them</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/our-rope-ladder/">rope ladder</a>.</li>
<li>We created a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/garden-in-a-week/">veggie garden</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kids have really grown up in this back yard! Together we have explored</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">frogs</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">butterflies</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/watching-nature-unfold-cicada/">cicadas</a>, and other <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bug-hunt/">insects</a></li>
<li>Plant life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/seedpods/">seedpods</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/fantastic-fungus/">fungi</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/scientific-literacy/">more fungi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am so glad I have these posts as a record of our outdoor adventures in their pre-school years. Now at 7 and 4, the kids are getting older and their needs in our new backyard will be different &#8211; but I know these early experiences will impact on the way they play. They know how to <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/sticks-and-stones/">make their own fun</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/the-big-branch/">solve problems together</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bamboo-panflutes/">be creative</a> outdoors.</p>
<p>I am sad to say goodbye to this home, but grateful for all the learning and growing that has happened here. And I am ready for what is next&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have bamboo in our backyard that goes wild after good rain. Out of nowhere the spears shoot up, rising way past the top of our 6ft fence, before sprouting leaves. It provides great screening, but often needs serious pruning! The kids have used the  pruned <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/outdoor-multi-age-play/">bamboo spears in their play </a>in the past. Recently we tried something new.<span id="more-6265"></span></p>
<p>Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>To make our panflute we first stripped the bamboo of leaves and cut sections of bamboo, which the kids ordered according to length. We wrapped string around the first section, joining it to the second, then the third, and so on. This was a bit fiddly. We then wrapped string around all of the five sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, we wrapped in between each section. This helped to pull it all together tightly. We trimmed all of the ends and left them hanging at one side. Traditionally these were often plaited decoratively, or used to create a neck strap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As you can see from the photos, our panflute is fairly rudimentary! We could have sanded the cut sections of bamboo, we could have sealed the ends with wax, we could have used a crossbar&#8230; If you want to try a more authentic method, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-4-easy-Bamboo-Flutes-for-free/step4/Bamboo-Flute-Panflute/">instructables</a> have a 50+ step DIY guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>For us, the fun of this activity was in making something from nothing. We created a real musical instrument with string, secateurs, and a plant from the backyard. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6269" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">What could you and your kids create in the backyard together&#8230;?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have previously shared some thoughts about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">children and risk</a>, both here on the blog and <a href="http://96five.com">on air</a>. And when my daughter knocked herself out by <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">falling while tree climbing</a> &#8211; my opinion was challenged, but ultimately unchanged.</p>
<p>While I am happy to share my perspective as an educator and a mother, I am not a child psychologist myself, so I was delighted to be able to interview <a href="http://www.pathwayshrc.com.au/about-us/professor-paula-barrett/">Dr Paula Barrett</a> about this topic.  Here are her thoughts on the risky business of childhood.<span id="more-6139"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6142" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Yes, my kids are playing with sticks&#8230;!)</p>
<p><strong>Paula, why is it important for children to be allowed to take risks in their play?</strong></p>
<p>There are several reasons but mainly because children learn and gain resilience through challenging experiences. If a child only ever does things within their comfort zone, where they completely understand all the potential outcomes, they don’t learn how to deal with not always achieving the right result or potential disappointment, which is extremely important in later life. Children learn the most when they are challenged.</p>
<p><strong>As parents, how do we know what is reasonable risk, and what is dangerous? </strong></p>
<p>Risk needs to be determined dependant on the particular child and what is developmentally appropriate. For example, a very young child may be able to climb a tree but doesn’t actually yet have the muscle strength for a successful climb – which can result in a dangerous situation. It is very useful to listen to your support networks to help guide you on this, such as grandparents who have great experience and parents with kids of a similar age as they may have dealt with similar situations.  There are also other networks you can rely on who have studied in this area, for example, child care workers, sport coaches etc – they can often make a valuable contribution to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Have today&#8217;s parents become too risk averse?  Why do you think this has happened?</strong></p>
<p>There are so many reasons for this but I think the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents are more isolated when bringing up children than they used to be. Involving your support networks can help you better evaluate risk by including those with experience, like grandparents or parents with kids of similar ages.</li>
<li>There are just so many rules – which are good in that they protect society at large however they can also inhibit children to take risk.</li>
<li>Kids time today is increasingly over-structured with too many scheduled activities &#8211; which minimises the opportunities children to be challenged outside of being told what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should we do to encourage children who are not natural risk takers?</strong></p>
<p>A great way to encourage children who are not natural risk takers is to help them form friendships with children who are.</p>
<p>And, as parents you can reassure them through modelling the behaviour– go outside with them and get involved.  You can try a step plan where you encourage them to face challenging situations in small steps – maybe once a week or once a fortnight, only moving them to the next step when they are ready.  It helps to reward them but not with things that you buy – it is more powerful to dedicate time to something that they love doing e.g. take them to the beach or build a cubby house with them.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any evidence to suggest that encouraging kids to take risks in play might lead to risky behaviour later in life? </strong></p>
<p>No, there is none at all! Children taking risks during play build self-confidence, whereas developing good judgement or self-regulation is another issue all together. Risk taking in adulthood is more about personality and life choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> _______________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Many thanks to Dr Paula Barrett for answering my questions about kids and risk, and the team from MILO for arranging the interview. I am proud to be a MILO Play Ambassador!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[5 outdoor activities using tin cans, plus win a MILO Play Kit]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very pleased to be an ambassador for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/miloausnz">MILO Play Movement</a> in 2012.  Play is a child&#8217;s work, and the importance of play in children&#8217;s development cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>MILO sent the SquiggleKids a fantastic play kit (final photo) to use in the backyard &#8211; and <strong>I&#8217;ve got one play kit to give away to a lucky SquiggleMum reader as well</strong>!  The kit contains soccer nets, cones, a selection of different balls and even a ball pump for your kids to use outside, plus a couple of tins of MILO.<span id="more-6036"></span></p>
<p>So of course, you know what my kids have had the most fun with, don&#8217;t you&#8230;?  <strong>The tins!!  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6041" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Kids have been inventing games with MILO tins for as long as MILO has been around. The labels might have changed, but not much else has. Here are 5 activities that are sure to bring back memories, and your own kids might like them too:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1.  Tin can stilts</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">2. Tin can telephone</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6043" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">3. Tin can bucket (on pulley rope)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6044" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">4. Tin can bowling</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6045" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">5. Tin can drums</p>

<p style="text-align: left">The kids have had SO much fun playing with a couple of tins. Sometimes I think commercial toys are entirely overrated.  That said, they were also pretty excited about this stuff:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6047" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/butterfly_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4885" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/butterfly_collage.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="283" /></a></p>
<p>We {heart} our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/playscape-nature-cubby/">nature cubby</a>.  Not only does the leafy roof provide shade for the dirt kitchen, but it also provides a home for many garden creatures.  The plant is a Monkey Rope Vine (<em>Parsonsia straminea</em>).  Monkey Rope is common around Brisbane, and it is an interesting (and fast growing) vine thanks to its <em>adventitious </em>roots.  These are roots which come out of the branches and stems of a plant.  Monkey Rope is also one of the host plants of the <a href="http://www.brisbaneinsects.com/brisbane_nymphs/Crow.htm">Common Australian Crow</a> (<em>Euploea core</em>) butterfly.<span id="more-4695"></span>We have delighted in watching the whole lifecycle of a Common Crow unfold in our own backyard.  We have found:</p>
<ul>

<p>It has been such a <strong>rich learning experience</strong> for the kids.  Every few days we check the vine to see what is happening with our Common Crows.  If we find a caterpillar, we check for it again each day and watch its growth.  If we find a chrysalis (the jackpot, as far as kids are concerned) we all ooh and aah and guess how many days it will be until the butterfly emerges.  Without being too &#8220;teacherly&#8221; I have been able to talk to the kids about life, death, growth, weather, change, insects, leaves, roots, predators and other science topics.</p>
