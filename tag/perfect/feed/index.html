<p>A friend of ours was recently discussing diamonds with us, after proposing to his girlfriend <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" />  It&#8217;s been over ten years since we went engagement-ring-shopping but I still remember learning about the 4 Cs &#8211; cut, clarity, colour and carat!  Our friend laughed about the fact that synthetic diamonds are often of equal beauty to natural diamonds&#8230; the only problem is that they are too perfect!<span id="more-5629"></span></p>
<p><strong>Too perfect</strong>. It&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve been thinking about ever since.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The wonder of a diamond lies in its unmatchable beauty.  But every diamond, no matter how magnificent, has imperfections of some kind.  These flaws fall into 2 categories: internal flaws are known as inclusions, while flaws on the surface of the diamond are called blemishes.&#8221;</em> (<a href="http://www.mazaldiamond.com/blog-en/diamond-blemishes-external-imperfection">source</a>)</p>
<p>The thing is, the imperfections in a diamond are often what makes it unique.  They rarely detract from the beauty of the stone, and they can usually only be seen under 10x magnification!  Maybe diamonds beat themselves up about their internal flaws and blemishes &#8211; but the rest of us see right past them.</p>
<p>You know where I&#8217;m going with this, right?  What if, as mothers, we are all diamonds?</p>
<p><em>&#8220;The wonder of a mother lies in her unmatchable beauty.  But every mother, no matter how magnificent, has imperfections of some kind.  These flaws fall into 2 categories: internal flaws are known as inclusions, while flaws on the surface of the mother are called blemishes.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>We beat ourselves up about our internal flaws, and our physical blemishes.  Chances are, others see right past them.  We compare ourselves to airbrushed, photoshopped, synthetic images of women portrayed in the media, forgetting that these are unrealistic.  And worse, while we only see snippets of a celebrity mother&#8217;s life, we &#8220;fill in the gaps&#8221; imagining that ALL of her life is equally perfect.</p>
<p>There are no perfect women. No perfect mothers. No perfect children, or families, or homes.  We all have flaws and blemishes that make us who we are.  They might mean that perfection is unattainable, but they don&#8217;t stop us from <strong><em>sparkling</em></strong>.</p>
<p>You, my friend, are a diamond mum. Perfectly imperfect.</p>
