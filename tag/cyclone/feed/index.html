				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the South-East part of the state recovers and rebuilds following <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/brisbane-floods-the-aftermath/">the floods</a>, the North and Far-North Queensland communities are bracing for the most severe cyclone we have ever seen.  Tropical Cyclone Yasi will hit tonight.  Schools have been closed for the rest of the week.  Hospitals have been evacuated.  Airports shut. Roads closed. Thousands and thousands of residents told to flee. This is a very, very serious storm.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cyclone_feb2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4760" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cyclone_feb2.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="402" /></a></p>

<p>There is likely to be extensive coverage on television networks for the next 48 hours, possibly longer (particularly in Qld).  Here are some things I learned about the coverage of a natural disaster during the recent floods:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be <strong>incessant</strong>.  Expect rolling coverage, and the cancellation of regular programming (including children&#8217;s shows).</li>
<li>It will be <strong>emotional</strong>.  Footage will show real people dealing with real feelings.</li>
<li>It will be <strong>traumatic</strong>.  Homes will be destroyed, and lives may be lost.</li>
<li>It will be <strong>dramatic</strong>.  In case a natural disaster isn&#8217;t dramatic enough on its own, you can be sure the footage will include carefully selected songs, slow motion scenes, soft focus tear-stained faces and images of precious possessions amid rubble.</li>
</ul>
<p>My message to you is to protect your children from <em>some </em>of the media storm if they are not directly affected.  It is up to us to expose our children to enough so that they understand what is happening at an <strong>age-appropriate</strong> level, yet protect them from some of the dramatic footage which they are not emotionally ready to deal with.  As I said with the last <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/brisbane-floods-processing-through-play/">natural disaster</a> in my state:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>As parents, we have a responsibility to walk our children  through times like this – and it isn’t always easy.  Their questions  need to be acknowledged, even if we can’t give them answers.  We have to  <em>know</em> our kids.  Really <em>know them</em>, in order to help  them make sense of the world around them. We have to know how much  information they can comprehend.  We have to know how sensitive they  are.  We have to know how much they are likely to worry.  We have to  know what will reassure them.  We have to <em>know</em> our kids.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Can I ask you to do two things?</p>
<ol>
<li>Please pray for those directly affected by this disaster.  If you are on <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum">twitter </a>you might like to use the hashtag #pray4qld as well as #TCYasi</li>
<li>Turn the TV off. Don&#8217;t leave it running, replaying the disaster over and over again in front of your kids.  Watch some together. Answer their questions. Talk about what we can all do to help. Then turn the TV off.</li>
</ol>
<h2><em>If you would like me, and other readers, to pray for anyone in particular in Yasi&#8217;s path, please just leave a comment below. We will hold them in prayer throughout the night and into tomorrow. Blessings, Cath. xx</em></h2>
