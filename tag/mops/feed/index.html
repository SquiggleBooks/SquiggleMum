				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have noticed I&#8217;ve been offline more than usual lately, because I&#8217;ve been super busy with the 2010/2011 Australasian <a href="http://mops.org.au">MOPS </a>Conference!  (<strong>M</strong>others <strong>O</strong>f <strong>P</strong>re <strong>S</strong>choolers)  I have been involved with Queensland Conferences for the last few years, but this is the first national one to be held since I became a mum in 2006.  Five mums from my group flew down to Sydney together for the weekend &#8211; without kids!  Here are my highlights from the Conference:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://colinbuchanan.com.au/">Colin Buchanan</a>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cath_colinB.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4110" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cath_colinB.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Playschool presenter, Christian children&#8217;s entertainer and Australian country singer Colin Buchanan came to perform for us on the Friday night.  Not only did he play all our kids&#8217; favourites, but he also played <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK7iu2S6zyI">Be My Friend: The Facebook Song</a> (for me!!) and wrote a gorgeous song about Aussie Mums.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Keynote Speakers from <a href="http://mops.org">MOPS International:</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cath_shelly_sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4111" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cath_shelly_sq.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">We were delighted to host two special guest who flew over from the US for our Conference.  Liz Selzer is a highly sought after speaker, and so vibrant on stage!  Pictured above is the current President of MOPS International: Shelly Radic.  I met Shelly a couple of years ago (when I was hugely pregnant!!) and it was wonderful to catch up with her again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Workshops:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/social_media_sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4114" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/social_media_sq.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">At all MOPS Conferences there are great elective workshops on offer.  As Coordinator of my local MOPS group I attended a workshop with Shelly Radic and met up with Coordinators from all over Australia, New Zealand and even Papua New Guinea.  I also had the opportunity to run an elective myself, and enjoyed sharing my knowledge of social media with other mums in leadership.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Worship:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cath_worship_coll2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4115" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/cath_worship_coll2.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">I was kinda busy during the weekend because it was my privilege to lead the Worship team.  What a buzz it was singing with 200 mums from around Australia!  A friend-and-fellow-MOPS-leader and I also co-wrote the theme song together for the Conference.  I was truly humbled to hear our song being used to worship God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>It was such an exciting weekend, and reminded me of why I am a MOPS Leader: <em>because better mums make a better world</em>.</strong></p>
