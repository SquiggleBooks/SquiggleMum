				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When meeting author/illustrator <a href="http://www.narelleoliver.com">Narelle Oliver</a> at the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/2012-national-year-of-reading-read-up-launch/">Read Up launch</a> recently, I <em><strong>might</strong></em> have mentioned that Miss 5 and I are kind of into birds&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;which of course lead us into a discussion about Narelle&#8217;s award winning picture book, <strong><em>Fox and Fine Feathers, </em></strong>with her signature linocut illustrations.<span id="more-5982"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5983" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Lyrebird, Coucal, Pitta and Nightjar are birds of the forest floor. Although as different as groundbirds can be, they always look out for danger and warn each other to hide. One day, Lyrebird, Coucal and Pitta forget to look out for Fox. Only Nightjar is watching. Can he warn the others in time?</em></p>
<p>We loved learning more about these four beautiful Australian rainforest birds from the story:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superb Lyrebirds</strong> are incredibly shy creatures.  They are rarely seen, but often heard as they mimic the calls of other birds.  Males have long, intricate tail feathers.</li>
<li><strong>Pheasant Coucals</strong> are sizeable black and brown birds. They are not particularly adept at flying, so prefer to run after their prey.</li>
<li><strong>Noisy Pittas</strong> are brightly coloured little rainforest birds.  They hop about in the undergrowth, and although quite common are not often seen.</li>
<li><strong>Long-tailed Nightjars</strong> are masters of disguise.  Their feathers are perfectly camouflaged amongst the leaf litter during the day while they sleep.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5986" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="313" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: left"></div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to talking about birds, we also discussed the problems introduced species, such as foxes, can cause to fragile ecosystems.  Other introduced species to Australia include cane toads, rabbits, and (feral) cats.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This picture book is not only a wonderful read, but is rich with opportunities to discuss habitats, birdlife, camouflage, predators and more.  Great for low to mid primary, and any kids with an interest in wildlife.  (For my teacher friends, Scholastic provide <a href="http://www.scholastic.com.au/schools/education/teacherresources/assets/pdfs/Fox_and_Fine_Feathers.pdf">Teachers&#8217; Notes</a> on <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for classroom use.)</div>
<p><strong>Courtesy of Narelle Oliver herself, I have a SIGNED copy of <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for one lucky SquiggleMum reader.  To enter, simply leave a comment below and tell me an Australian bird that your kids have seen in your area.  </strong>(It&#8217;s a great excuse to  look out for birds this week&#8230;)  One entry per person, Aussie residents only, comp closes Sun 18/3/12 8pm Qld time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-pitta2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5987" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-pitta2-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; If you adore Narelle&#8217;s work, prints from the book are available at the gorgeous <a href="http://www.marksandgardner.com/">Marks and Gardner</a> gallery online, or at their beautiful premises on Mt Tamborine.  Tell them SquiggleMum sent you <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></em></p>
<p>*I received a copy of the book from Narelle Oliver, but did not receive payment for this post.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is sponsored by Kidspot and I received payment for the review.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GetSquiggling_Image4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5386" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GetSquiggling_Image4.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>A kids’ program about a sweet monster named Squiglet who loves to squiggle – how could SquiggleMum resist a review?!  <a href="http://www.bbcaustralia.com/cbeebies">Get Squiggling</a> airs on the CBeebies channel, weekdays at 8:30am.<span id="more-5378"></span></p>
<p>Squiglet loves to draw with his squiggle sticks.  His illustrations transform the white world around him into a colourful and magical place, where characters jump off the page and come to life.  Need to find some buried treasure? Squiglet can squiggle you a spade. Need to cross a crocodile-infested moat? Squiglet can squiggle you a boat. Need to get somewhere far away? Squiglet can even squiggle you a rocket!</p>
<p><iframe width="604" height="340" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MLzdlDvmpIk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>Creative and Educational Consultant Brian Neish, shares what children may pick up from <a href="http://www.bbcaustralia.com/cbeebies">Get Squiggling</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about colour and colour combination</li>
<li>Ways to describe drawn lines</li>
<li>Knowledge about how to draw particular line types</li>
<li>An understanding of the way drawing can be used to represent imaginative      thought</li>
<li>An understanding of the way lines can be used to create shape, form      and space in an organised and representational manner</li>
<li>Knowledge about a range of both familiar and unfamiliar animals and      characters</li>
<li>Knowledge about a range of places and environments, including their      unique features</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GetSquiggling_Image3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5383" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GetSquiggling_Image3.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>Both of my kids enjoy watching the program.  It is well pitched for my two year old, but it is my five year old who loves to draw.  A program like <a href="http://www.bbcaustralia.com/cbeebies">Get Squiggling</a> can be a great springboard into other creative activities from which you can reinforce the learning outlined above.  Children can only learn so much by watching – it is in the <strong><em>doing</em></strong> that pathways are formed in the brain, rich language is used in conversation, fine motor skills are developed, and true learning occurs.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas to help you with the <strong><em>doing</em></strong>, after the viewing!</p>
<ul>
<li>Make up some mini-squiggle kits so that the kids can draw easily anywhere.  A small notepad and 4xcrayon pack in a ziploc bag can be kept in your handbag for when you are on the go.  <em>Try: playing a squiggling game! Draw a few lines and encourage your child to turn it into a picture. What could it be? (Ah yes, some of you remember Mr Squiggle…)</em></li>
<li>Provide materials for squiggling outdoors.  Children’s imaginations seem to soar outside!  Give your child a clipboard stocked with paper, and a cup of crayons.  <em>Try: encouraging your child to draw what they see, as well as what they imagine.  Use lots of descriptive language when talking with your child. </em></li>
<li>Think BIG!  <em>Try: using large sheets of butcher’s paper on the floor (or a large box opened out flat) to help your child draw an imaginary world.  “Is there a jungle? Are there rivers?  Who lives in this house?  Don’t fall into the quicksand…!”</em></li>
<li>Squiggle a book together. A simple recount is a great format for young kids and is a valuable language and memory activity.  <em>Try: squiggling about an experience you have (very) recently had together. Write a simple sentence on each page, and encourage your child to illustrate it.  “I went to the shops with Mummy. I saw cornflakes. I saw apples. I saw milk. I saw pizza. I saw lots of trolleys!” </em></li>
<li>Different mediums produce different results.  Provide your child with more than just crayons.  Let them experience pencils, felt pens, chalk, oil pastels, charcoal and more.  <em>Try: drawing on the concrete with chalk.</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/squiggle-kids.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5384" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/squiggle-kids.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="538" /></a></p>
<p><em> </em><em> </em></p>
<p>If followed up with creative opportunities at home, <a href="http://www.bbcaustralia.com/cbeebies">Get Squiggling</a> can be a useful and enjoyable program.</p>
<p><em>SquiggleKids rating: 4 stars. “I like Squiglet. He’s fun and he likes to draw and so do I.  I like how he imagines things and draws whatever he thinks about.” The kids also enjoy singing along with the opening song!</em></p>
<p><em>SquiggleMum rating: 3 stars (when used in conjunction with real opportunities for drawing). I prefer more emphasis on process over product, but the program is enjoyable and it has inspired us to get squiggling together!</em></p>
<p><strong>Do your kids like to squiggle?  What other ideas do you have for encouraging drawing at home?  Leave a comment below!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I need to be upfront and tell you that Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com/art-not-craft-the-process-of-learning-creatively-ebook/">Childhood101</a> and I aren&#8217;t just blogging colleagues &#8211; we&#8217;re friends.*  And when I say I like her ebook &#8211; I mean I <em>love </em>it.  So much so that I contributed a few photos, helped with editing and I am a proud <a href="//www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585&quot; target=&quot;ejejcsingle&quot;&gt;Click here to view more details&lt;/a&gt;">affiliate</a>.  (That means if you purchase the ebook because I said it&#8217;s awesome, I get a percentage of the profits too.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5071" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/artnotcraft_300x250-banner.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="//www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585&quot; target=&quot;ejejcsingle&quot;&gt;Click here to view more details&lt;/a&gt;"><em>ART not Craft</em></a></strong> is a downloadable, 53 page ebook in a pdf format.  Instead of buying a paper-and-cover book, you purchase an ebook and either print it out, or read it on the screen.  It is in full colour and contains lots of great photos of young children in action with a variety of mediums.</p>
<p><strong>How much is it?</strong></p>
<p>Using an e-format keeps overheads low, so you can purchase it for <strong>$15.95</strong> (<em>and </em>you get a bonus gift).  If you could book an early childhood consultant to sit down over coffee while you pick her brain about all-things-art, it would cost a fortune!  This book is kind of like that.  Oh, except Christie is totally a tea drinker&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s in it?<a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/artnotcraft-photos.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5076" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/artnotcraft-photos.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="251" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Loads of information on <em>why </em>we approach art in the early years the way we do, and great ideas for you to try.  <em><strong>ART not Craft</strong></em> is broken into sections on drawing, painting, printmaking, collage and sculpture.  Christie gives suggestions throughout for learning, doing, seeing, and talking with your child as you go.  It is a resource you will go back to many times.</p>
<p><strong>Who should buy it?</strong></p>
<p>If you have ever given your child a blob of playdough, or put a paintbrush into their hand and thought, &#8220;Now what&#8230;?!&#8221; &#8211; this is a book for you!  Many parents want to be creative with their kids, and want to provide creative learning opportunities, but just don&#8217;t know where to start.  It&#8217;s also a great resource for anyone working with under fives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>When asked to comment on the book, here&#8217;s what I had to say:</strong><em><em> </em></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><em>&#8220;Children are inherently creative, and are capable of doing so  much more than merely copying simple crafts.  In this ebook Christie  opens up a world of possibilities for you to explore with your child, or  with a whole class of young children. I highly recommend <strong>Art Not  Craft</strong> to parents and educators who are looking to provide rich,  creative and artistic opportunities for the children in their care.&#8221;<br />
</em></em></p>

<p>BONUS!  Purchase <em><strong><a href="//www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585&quot; target=&quot;ejejcsingle&quot;&gt;Click here to view more details&lt;/a&gt;">Art Not Craft: The Process of Learning Creatively</a></strong></em> <em>and you will receive ‘A Wish For All Children’ poster as a  downloadable, easy to print A4 PDF. Hang it in your home to inspire and  remind you of the importance of children making art.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spray bottles are a regular play item in our backyard during the warmer months, but with Autumn in the air it&#8217;s been a little too cool for this:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_play.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5034" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_play.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">So instead I&#8217;ve been encouraging the kids to use the spray bottles differently. They&#8217;ve enjoyed using them to water in new plants, and lightly mist delicate fern leaves.  They&#8217;ve had fun squirting them high into the air.  Most of all, we&#8217;ve enjoyed creating water spray art together.  <span id="more-5012"></span>We didn&#8217;t set out to &#8220;do&#8221; this activity.  It just happened naturally out of playful exploration.  The first successful picture Miss 4 made was this one (below). I thought it was delightful and quickly snapped a pic:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_art.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5035" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_art.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Then we collected sticks and leaves, and talked about which items in the backyard would work well for water spray pictures.  We created this artwork together.  I took a photo of the natural set up first, then we sprayed our water bottles over the top, and removed the objects to reveal our art.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_how_to.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5036" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_how_to.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">All sorts of wonderful art followed, including this little masterpiece of a person.  It was created with rocks for the head and body, and leaves for arms and legs.  Miss 4 was so proud of herself when she finally achieved a recognisable person!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_person.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5037" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/water_spray_person.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids don&#8217;t know it, of course, but this is actually very similar to a method used by indigenous Australians when painting on cave walls.  Instead of a spray bottle, the Aboriginal people mixed the ochre-and-water paint in their mouths, and spat it onto the rock.  Often they used their own hand as a stencil.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stick_sculpture2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4057" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/stick_sculpture2.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>After <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/boys/birthday-boy-and-bear/">Mr 2&#8217;s birthday</a> there were lots of new and exciting gifts to open.  Several toys were wired into boxes with clear coated wires about 20cm each in length.  I kept them, figuring they would come in handy for something.  It&#8217;s a teacher thing &#8211; we can&#8217;t help ourselves!!</p>
<p>The kids collected a nice bunch of sticks from the backyard the other day, and we played around with them for a while before deciding to turn them into a &#8220;sculpture&#8221;.  (This is a word Miss 4 knows from visiting the Art Gallery and exploring different mediums with her artist-Nanna.)  My daughter&#8217;s first suggestion was to attach the sticks to each other with sticky tape.  We discussed whether sticky tape would hold very well to the bark and wood, and decided string would be better.  When we went to get some string, we discovered the wires!  Perfect!!</p>
<p>Wiring the sticks together was fiddly for a four year old, but fantastic for fine motor skill development.  She put the sticks and wires where she wanted them, and I just tightened up the joints.  It was also her idea to add some feathers into the joints, and I think the final result is rather lovely.</p>
<p>The sculpture is sitting on top of a skinny cabinet in the hallway just beside the back door.  This Ikea cabinet is fabulous because everyone in the family has their own drawer for outside boots and hats!  The birdcage decals run right along the hallway, so my daughter&#8217;s addition of feathers to the sticks seems just right.</p>
