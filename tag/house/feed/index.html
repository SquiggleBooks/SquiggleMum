				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word &#8220;home&#8221; has been on my mind a lot these past few weeks. What is home?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Home-wifi-squigglemum.png"><img class="wp-image-6468 aligncenter" alt="Home wifi squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Home-wifi-squigglemum-682x1024.png" width="434" height="653" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Home is a roof overhead</strong>. At least in the short term, <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/mums/hello-sydney/">&#8220;home&#8221; for us in Sydney</a> is a rental house. To be honest I feel unsettled living in a rented property. The house is lovely, and I am so grateful for it, but making it feel like it&#8217;s <em><strong>ours</strong></em> is challenging. <span id="more-6467"></span>No repainting feature walls, or hanging pictures where ever I like, and certainly no demolition of any kind! What I can do though is surround us with familiarity. I can put familiar faces on the fridge, I can put familiar cushions on the couch, and I can bake familiar things in the oven. (Actually, I haven&#8217;t quite worked out my oven here yet&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Home is where ever we&#8217;re together</strong>. Cliched, I know. It&#8217;s funny how true it is though when you relocate a family. There are <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/activities/goodbye-brisbane/">things I miss about Brisbane</a>, but I&#8217;m not &#8220;homesick&#8221; because we&#8217;re here together. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">At the end of the day, it&#8217;s the togetherness that matters most. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">And the things that I do miss aren&#8217;t things anyway &#8211; they are people. I have wonderful friends in Brissy, and around the world, who will still be my friends no matter how far apart we are. A big move gives you a real perspective shift. </span></p>
<p><strong>Home is eternal</strong>. As a Christian, I also believe I have a forever-home in heaven and I need to remind myself that nothing here on earth is permanent. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">As I wrestle with the question of what home is, t</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">he unsettled feeling in my soul is probably good for me. My eyes should be fixed on something far greater than a nice house and a nice life. </span></p>
<p><strong>So what is home for you? Home is&#8230; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; while I&#8217;m on the topic of home, you might notice that my blog-home has been given a makeover too! It&#8217;s a cleaner, simpler design that is mobile friendly. Hope you like. Cath x</em></p>
