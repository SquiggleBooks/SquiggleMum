				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few new releases have crossed my desk in the lead up to Christmas, and few others I have heard about from colleagues. Here is a quick round up of what&#8217;s new on the shelves, and who these picture books might be suitable for as a gift this Christmas&#8230;<span id="more-6829"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/count-my-christmas-kisses.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6831 size-medium" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/count-my-christmas-kisses-298x300.jpg" alt="count-my-christmas-kisses" width="298" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;One kiss for baby, under mistletoe. Two kisses for baby, catching falling snow&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Count My Christmas Kisses</p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: Harper Collins / ABC Books</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: Ruthie May</p>
<p><strong>Illustrator</strong>: Tamsin Ainslie</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: A sweet, simple counting book perfect for baby&#8217;s first Christmas. It&#8217;s unfortunately very European for an Australian picture book (no snow here!) but it is delightful nonetheless. Recommended for Under 2s, and for young children who have welcomed a baby sibling this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mr-Darcy-Pudding.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6832 size-medium" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mr-Darcy-Pudding-300x295.png" alt="Mr Darcy Pudding" width="300" height="295" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;With the fire crackling in the background, they all helped with the mixture for Mr Darcy&#8217;s famous Christmas pudding&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Mr Darcy and the Christmas Pudding</p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: New Frontier</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: Alex Field</p>
<p><strong>Illustrator</strong>: Peter Carnavas</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: Alex Field has previously released two other Mr Darcy books, also illustrated by Peter Carnavas. This one incorporates the tradition of Stir Up Sunday, and a brief factual account of the origin of the tradition is included at the end. For fans of Mr Darcy &#8211; the duck. Recommended for ages 5-8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/monster-christmas-tree-farts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6833 size-medium" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/monster-christmas-tree-farts-300x300.jpg" alt="monster-christmas-tree-farts" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;His bauble bombs smell so bad I can&#8217;t wrap presents in my room&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: There is a Monster Under My Christmas Tree Who Farts</p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: Harper Collins / ABC Books</p>
<p><strong>Author/Illustrator</strong>: Tim Miller and Matt Stanton</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: I cannot believe I just typed that title on my blog. Sigh. Ok, ok, so it&#8217;s not my style &#8211; but it is bound to appeal to some kids this Christmas. And to Uncles. Lots and lots of uncles. Recommended for Uncles aged 20-50.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas-Other-2014.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6834 size-large" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas-Other-2014-1024x341.jpg" alt="Christmas-Other-2014" width="604" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>Other highly recommended new releases to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One Night</strong> (Penny Matthews / Stephen Michael King). This tells the story of the first Christmas through the eyes of the animals and is my pick for 2014.</li>
<li><strong>Tea and Sugar Christmas</strong> (Jane Jolly / Robert Ingpen). Based on the true story of the train that travelled across the Nullabor Plain weekly for over 80 years. Features critically acclaimed Australian illustrator Robert Ingpen.</li>
<li><strong>Little Dog and the Christmas Wish</strong> (Corinne Fenton / Robin Cowcher). The illustrations are quintessentially Melbourne, and Corinne Fenton&#8217;s stories are always poetically told. For dog lovers.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like many families, we have a growing collection of Christmas books. I keep these with the Christmas tree and decorations so that they only come out in December. We add one or two each year to the <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/lilys-wish/">existing favourites</a>. As we are Christians, it is important that the kids have books which tell the real story of Jesus&#8217; birth, as well as fun stories about Santa.<span id="more-6584"></span></p>
<p>If you are looking to add to your own collection of Christmas picture books, try these:</p>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">A very simple but sweet story about a mouse who lends Santa and Rudolph a helping hand. Suitable for younger readers and will probably appeal most to little girls.</span></p>

<p><strong>SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong>:</p>
<p>An entertaining tale about how Santa spends Christmas Day, after he has delivered all of the presents. Apparently he is quite the surfer! Kids of all ages will love this one, with its fun rhyming text and retro illustrations. An excellent read for boys.</p>

<p><strong>SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong>:</p>
<p>This beautiful story reads more like a lilting song, with &#8220;Jesus, born for us&#8221; as a refrain after each verse. Unlike most nativity stories, which finish with angels heralding Jesus&#8217; birth, this story continues past the birth and onto Jesus&#8217; childhood. It also includes the connection between Christmas and Easter, and finishes with our response to all Jesus has done for us.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>I have had the pleasure of <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/samuels-kisses-book-review/">meeting illustrator Serena Geddes</a>, and watching her draw in front of a bunch of over-excited kids! She is utterly charming.  Her latest picture book will certainly be much loved in our house &#8211; especially by Miss 5.  This post is written by her&#8230;<span id="more-5733"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lilys-wish-cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5735" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lilys-wish-cover.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="416" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p><em>Dear Serena,</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for delivering Lily&#8217;s Wish to me. I think it&#8217;s a great book. Other five year old girls like me will really love it, especially if their name is Lily &#8211; like mine!  Here are some questions about the book.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Where did you do the pictures?  Do you have a special office (studio) where you do art?</li>
<li>Did you use watercolours to paint the illustrations? What else did you use to make the pictures?</li>
<li>My favourite picture is the first one where Lily is sitting at her desk doing work. It looks just like me! Which is your favourite picture?</li>
<li>I liked your pictures in Samuel&#8217;s Kisses and Lily&#8217;s Wish. What is your very next book going to be?</li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>Love Lily xxxxxxxxx</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lily-santa.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5736" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/lily-santa.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="305" /></a><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>Dear Lily,</em></p>
<p><em>What a lovely surprise it was to receive this email from you, not only are these very good questions I think it is extra special that one of my books has been reviewed by a young reader who has the same name as Lily! <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></em></p>
<p><em>I am glad you like Lily&#8217;s Wish it is one of my favourite books becuase I have nephew&#8217;s and a niece who live in London so I have travelled to see them all the way over in the United Kingdom. Have you been to London? It is very nice, but a little cold and it seems to rain a lot <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></em></p>
<p><em>Here are my answers to your questions:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Where did you do the pictures?  Do you have a special office (studio) where you do art?</strong> </em><em>I work from my home in Sydney and have set up my desk in the front room that has a lot of sunlight and plenty of room so I can lay out all my paintings on the floor. This helps me see how the colours and illustrations would look if it was laid out in a book.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Did you use watercolours to paint the illustrations? What else did you use to make the pictures? </strong></em><em>I drew the pictures using a 2B pencil and then painted them in watercolour. Some of the drawings have a little bit of coloured pencil over it, like Lily&#8217;s hair and Santa&#8217;s suit. Seeing this was the first time I had drawn scenery I had to use a lot of reference material searching on the computer for pictures of the Sydney Harbour and Big Ben in London.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>My favourite picture is the first one where Lily is sitting at her desk doing work. It looks just like me! Which is your favourite picture? </strong></em><em>That is my mum&#8217;s favourite picture too! I do like the first picture but my favourite is of the Reindeer flying over London past Big Ben.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>I liked your pictures in Samuel&#8217;s Kisses and Lily&#8217;s Wish. What is your very next book going to be? </strong></em><em>I am glad you like Samuel&#8217;s Kisses and Lily&#8217;s Wish! <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </em><em>My next book is the 4th book in the series for Totally Twins. I am working on the front cover at the moment but shhh&#8230; it&#8217;s a secret. Author Aleesah Darlison is still working on it!</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>I hope I have helped with your questions.  I have a question for you Lily, can I put your questions on my <a href="http://www.reeni.com.au/">website</a> news page? I am sure other readers would love to see your review and questions <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></em></p>
<p><em>Speak soon!</em></p>
<p><em>Serena.<br />

<p><em>Dear Serena,</em></p>
<p><em>I haven&#8217;t been to London but my friend Holly lives there and I would like to visit her one day.

<p>A very happy Christmas to all of my readers!  May you and your families be blessed at this special time of year.  On Christmas Day, make sure you look your kids right in the eye and tell them that you love them, and that you are so glad they are yours.  There is no greater gift you can give your children than unconditional love.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t forget that you too are loved unconditionally &#8211; by the One who started all this Christmas stuff in the first place. </strong></p>
<p>Thank you all for your comments, emails, tweets, and most of all friendship in 2010.  Enjoy this socialmedia-savvy retelling of the Nativity Story&#8230;</p>
<p><em><strong>With blessings,</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/christmas_eve2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4445" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/christmas_eve2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="332" /></a></p>
<p>We are always busy, busy on Christmas Day.  Two excited kids will rush to stockings at dawn, we&#8217;ll be off to church at 7am where I&#8217;ll be singing, and then we&#8217;ll be sharing with friends and family all day.  Lots of presents to give, and food to eat, and love to share.</p>
<p>But Christmas Eve is our special time.  Our time for the four of us to just be a family together.</p>
<ul>
<li>We wrap the last of the presents.</li>
<li>We read the Christmas Story together.</li>
<li>The kids put out their stockings.</li>
<li>We turn the house lights off and sit in front of the twinkling tree.</li>
<li>We pray for others &#8211; especially for less fortunate families in Australia, for children living in poverty, and for all those who will be working on Christmas Day.</li>
<li>We get the kids into bed early!  They need a good night&#8217;s sleep before the big day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then hubby and I get time to ourselves.  There are always carols by candlelight* on tv, so while we listen we wrap the kids&#8217; presents, and prepare food for the next day.  In the &#8220;calm before the storm&#8221; we take a moment to be grateful for all the blessings in our lives.</p>
<p><strong>How do you spend Christmas Eve?</strong></p>
<p><em>(* In Australia, Christmas is in our mid-summer. We have a tradition of big-scale, outdoor Christmas concerts where everyone sits on blankets with candles to sing carols together.  The biggest of these are televised nationally and include performances by Australia&#8217;s finest entertainers.) </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fruitbowl.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4347" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/fruitbowl.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="420" /></a></p>
<p>As 2010 comes to a close (oh. my. goodness!) we say goodbye to some of the people in our &#8220;village&#8221; who have helped to raise our kids:  teachers, carers, coaches, babysitters, specialists&#8230; But what to give to show our appreciation?</p>
<p>This morning on air I suggested some alternatives to the usual gifts:</p>
<p>Listen here! <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/SquiggleMum-Podcast-thankyou-gifts.mp3">SquiggleMum Podcast &#8211; thankyou gifts</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of chocolates&#8230; give a bowl of fruit.</li>
<li>Instead of a bunch of flowers&#8230; give a potted plant.</li>
<li>Instead of a book or calendar&#8230; give a magazine.</li>
<li>Instead of a coffee mug&#8230; give a range of teas or some gorgeous coffee.</li>
<li>More than anything&#8230; make sure you include a handwritten thank you card or note.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two fruitbowls (one pictured above), wrapped in clear cellophane and finished with a Christmas bow went to my daughter&#8217;s kindy teachers yesterday.  What a wonderful year she has had!  Of course we included two thank you cards, and a handmade gift for use in the kindy.  (It is summer here in Australia, so our fruitbowls were full of delicious stonefruits and juicy mango. Mmmm.)</p>
<p><em>Don&#8217;t forget &#8211; when it comes to thank you gifts, the amount you spend is NOT an indication of how grateful you are!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week on 96Five FM (podcast below) I talked about their current campaign to send 3500 letters to soldiers serving away from home this Christmas.  Many readers will know that I grew up in an Army family myself.  My Dad served in the Australian Defence Force for 20 years, and much of my childhood was spent moving where ever Dad was posted.  I remember the times when Dad was away.  We missed him, and I&#8217;m sure he missed us too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://96five.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4309" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/letters-to-war-image002.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="113" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This year many Aussie families will be missing loved ones at Christmas because they are serving overseas. Kids will miss Dads.  Husbands will miss wives.  Parents will miss their adult children.  And soldiers will miss all that Christmas means to them back home.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em><strong>So will you join me in writing a letter?  Just <a href="http://96five.com/resource/96FiveInsert.pdf">print off the letter head</a> and write a quick note.  All the instructions you need are available on <a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=8083">96Five&#8217;s site</a>.  Letters need to arrive at 96Five by this Friday, 10th December in order to make it into the hands of troops for Christmas.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I helped Miss 4 to write her own letter.  Her words are precious, &#8220;You might miss your family at Christmas and feel sad.  Don&#8217;t worry because you can blow kisses to them.  Kisses can fly all around the world (and they don&#8217;t pop)!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/war-letter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4313" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/war-letter.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you&#8217;d like to hear my radio interview it&#8217;s available here: <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/SquiggleMum-Podcast-letters-to-war.mp3">SquiggleMum Podcast &#8211; letters to war</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PS &#8211; I wish I could also write a letter to every Mummy who has to manage this Christmas on her own with the kids while Daddy is away.  I would tell each mum that her kids won&#8217;t appreciate what she does, or notice how hard it is for her right now, but one day they&#8217;ll grow up. And then they will. xx</p>
