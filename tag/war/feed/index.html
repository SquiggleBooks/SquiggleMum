				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week on 96Five FM (podcast below) I talked about their current campaign to send 3500 letters to soldiers serving away from home this Christmas.  Many readers will know that I grew up in an Army family myself.  My Dad served in the Australian Defence Force for 20 years, and much of my childhood was spent moving where ever Dad was posted.  I remember the times when Dad was away.  We missed him, and I&#8217;m sure he missed us too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://96five.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4309" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/letters-to-war-image002.jpg" alt="" width="416" height="113" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This year many Aussie families will be missing loved ones at Christmas because they are serving overseas. Kids will miss Dads.  Husbands will miss wives.  Parents will miss their adult children.  And soldiers will miss all that Christmas means to them back home.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em><strong>So will you join me in writing a letter?  Just <a href="http://96five.com/resource/96FiveInsert.pdf">print off the letter head</a> and write a quick note.  All the instructions you need are available on <a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=8083">96Five&#8217;s site</a>.  Letters need to arrive at 96Five by this Friday, 10th December in order to make it into the hands of troops for Christmas.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I helped Miss 4 to write her own letter.  Her words are precious, &#8220;You might miss your family at Christmas and feel sad.  Don&#8217;t worry because you can blow kisses to them.  Kisses can fly all around the world (and they don&#8217;t pop)!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/war-letter.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4313" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/war-letter.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you&#8217;d like to hear my radio interview it&#8217;s available here: <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/SquiggleMum-Podcast-letters-to-war.mp3">SquiggleMum Podcast &#8211; letters to war</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PS &#8211; I wish I could also write a letter to every Mummy who has to manage this Christmas on her own with the kids while Daddy is away.  I would tell each mum that her kids won&#8217;t appreciate what she does, or notice how hard it is for her right now, but one day they&#8217;ll grow up. And then they will. xx</p>
