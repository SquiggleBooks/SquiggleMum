<p>If you are in Melbourne this weekend, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://lamingtondrive.com/exhibitions/event/i-ve-an-uncle-ivan/">book launch</a> not to be missed. Friend and colleague, <a href="http://bensillustrations.blogspot.com.au/">Ben Sanders</a>, is launching his first picture book! Ben is a <a href="http://themilkagency.com.au/">graphic designer</a> and illustrator of serious repute. His work regularly appears in mags, newspapers, books and advertising. You&#8217;ve probably seen his cool design work without even knowing. But, after reading &#8220;I&#8217;ve an Uncle Ivan&#8221; with your kids &#8211; you&#8217;re sure to recognise his work in the future.<span id="more-6280"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve an Uncle Ivan&#8221; is a free-wheeling rhyme illustrated in a nostalgic 1950s style that introduces readers to Uncle Ivan, his extended family and 14 different modes of transport. Ivan has a niece on skates, who has two hitchhiking brothers. They have a cousin on a scooter, whose sister drives a Mini&#8230; And so it goes until we meet the whole family, who are travelling to a secret destination on every form of transport from unicycles to bi-planes to trams!Â </em></p>
<p>And yes, Ben really does have an Uncle called Ivan.</p>
<p>I love the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/endpapers/">endpapers</a> in this cool, quirky book. There&#8217;s even a 3D model that kids can pop out, colour, and build so that they can retell the story and interact with the characters. Check it out!</p>

<p>The <a href="http://lamingtondrive.com/exhibitions/event/i-ve-an-uncle-ivan/">launch</a> this Saturday is bound to be a hoot. Expect lemonade and fairy bread, balloon artist, activities and more. If you get along to it, tell Ben (and his wife and kids) I said hi&#8230;</p>
