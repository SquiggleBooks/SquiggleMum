		<description><![CDATA[So what is it exactly that makes this show stand out, and attract such a wave of support from parents and children?  Here are 8 (hehehe...) reasons why Octonauts are awesome.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To say the <em><strong>Octonauts</strong></em> have captured my kids&#8217; imaginations is an understatement, and I don&#8217;t think my children are alone!  I&#8217;ve overheard mums talking about the program, and kids role playing their favourite characters.  The Octonauts follows a team of adventure heroes who dive into action whenever there is trouble under the sea.  In  a fleet of aquatic vehicles they rescue amazing sea creatures, explore  incredible new underwater worlds and often save the day before returning  safely to their home base, the Octopod.<span id="more-5581"></span></p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L57l19PWuI&#038;feature=related</p>
<p>So what is it exactly that makes this show stand out, and attract such a  wave of support from parents and children?  Here are 8 (hehehe&#8230;)  reasons why <em><strong>Octonauts </strong></em>are awesome:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong>.  This program is a visual feast.  The talented duo from <a href="http://www.meomi.com/">Meomi </a>create a stunning CGI underwater world which combines true aspects of aquatic life with imaginary elements.</li>
<li><strong>Soundtrack</strong>.  Composer Darren Hendley (who also wrote the music for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/children/olivia/">Olivia</a>) brings to the program a high quality score reminiscent of any sci-fi-action-adventure film.  The music isn&#8217;t limited to opening and closing credits either. It features throughout each ten minute episode, adding to the excitement.</li>
<li><strong>Non-fiction content</strong>.  Each episode features an underwater animal in its natural habitat.  Along with the Octonauts, kids learn about interesting behaviours or unusual characteristics of each animal.</li>
<li><strong>Tried and true formula. </strong>Anyone who has watched their share of sci-fi adventures will recognise the similarities between the Octonauts and the crew from the Enterprise, or SG1, or&#8230;.  (Yes, I am married to a <a href="http://distractable.net">geek</a>).  Strong leader + shy medic + scientist-with-a-Scottish-accent + fearless adventurer = awesome team!</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent entertainment</strong>. Children&#8217;s programs which are &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; make me groan.  I believe television shows for kids should be language-rich, introduce interesting vocabulary, and model excellent use of conversation.  Octonauts more than meets my criteria in this department.</li>
<li><strong>Target age. </strong>There often seems to be a lack of good quality entertainment appropriate for kids in the 4-7 age range.  Between toddlers and tweenagers is a whole stage (which seems to be disappearing) called childhood!!  This program is ideal for lower primary aged kids. Yay!</li>
<li><strong>Environmental awareness</strong>.  I&#8217;m always happy for my kids to watch a television program which encourages them to get back outside after it&#8217;s finished, exploring the natural world and the creatures in it.  The &#8220;<em>Explore! Rescue! Protect!</em>&#8221; tagline of the Octonauts is relevant in any habitat.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>.  This program isn&#8217;t about good-guys and bad-guys.  It&#8217;s about good-guys and misunderstood-guys.  This is particularly important in the context of real animals.  There are no evil animals.  Sometimes creatures can harm us, but it is not because they are &#8220;bad&#8221; in any way.  Usually when animals hurt us it is because they are afraid and are defending themselves or their young.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_rainbow_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5427" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_rainbow_collage.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>My kids are huge fans of Justine Clarke, and I am a big supporter of her work as an Australian children&#8217;s entertainer.  I&#8217;ve met her <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/justine-clarke-in-concert/">backstage</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-interview-dvd-giveaway/">interviewed </a>her, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-great-big-giveaway/">reviewed and given away</a> her albums and dvds&#8230; <strong>and now I am delighted to be able to give away tickets to her <em>Little Day Out</em> Tour!</strong> I have TWO double-passes for a couple of lucky SquiggleMum readers.<span id="more-5420"></span></p>
<p>In order to win a pair of tickets, simply share your favourite Justine song!  Do <span style="text-decoration: line-through">you</span> your kids have a favourite?  I couldn&#8217;t pick between my top 3 songs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_colours.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5428" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_colours-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" /></a>Mrs Knife and Mr Fork</em> &#8211; One of my early faves.  For a children&#8217;s  song, the lyrics are just sublime.  Justine rocks a fifties vibe in the  film clip, and there&#8217;s lots of cool percussion played on cutlery.</li>
<li><em>Song to Make You Smile</em> &#8211; This song really does make me smile, and I sing it to the kids to make them smile too.  It has such a sweet melodic introduction, with a catchy chorus and positive message.</li>
<li><em>My Shadow and Me</em> &#8211; I loved this jazz number the first time I heard it, and I never tire of it.  Justine and her team really do set the standard when it comes to creating musically sophisticated, yet age appropriate for our kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>So over to you. Do you agree with my choices, or have a different favourite?<strong> Leave a comment sharing your favourite Justine Clarke song and you could win a double pass to the nearest venue (Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane)!</strong></p>
<p><em>One entry per person please, and you must be able to get to either the Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane show.  Two winners will be chosen at random.  Competition closes 8pm Qld time, Sunday 7/8/11.</em></p>
<p>Justine would love you to visit her <a href="http://www.facebook.com/JustineLikesToSing">facebook page</a>, or stop by her <a href="http://justineclarke.com.au/">website</a> for updates and info.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is sponsored by Kidspot and I received payment for the review.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GetSquiggling_Image4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5386" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GetSquiggling_Image4.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>A kids’ program about a sweet monster named Squiglet who loves to squiggle – how could SquiggleMum resist a review?!  <a href="http://www.bbcaustralia.com/cbeebies">Get Squiggling</a> airs on the CBeebies channel, weekdays at 8:30am.<span id="more-5378"></span></p>
<p>Squiglet loves to draw with his squiggle sticks.  His illustrations transform the white world around him into a colourful and magical place, where characters jump off the page and come to life.  Need to find some buried treasure? Squiglet can squiggle you a spade. Need to cross a crocodile-infested moat? Squiglet can squiggle you a boat. Need to get somewhere far away? Squiglet can even squiggle you a rocket!</p>

<p>Creative and Educational Consultant Brian Neish, shares what children may pick up from <a href="http://www.bbcaustralia.com/cbeebies">Get Squiggling</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge about colour and colour combination</li>
<li>Ways to describe drawn lines</li>
<li>Knowledge about how to draw particular line types</li>
<li>An understanding of the way drawing can be used to represent imaginative      thought</li>
<li>An understanding of the way lines can be used to create shape, form      and space in an organised and representational manner</li>
<li>Knowledge about a range of both familiar and unfamiliar animals and      characters</li>
<li>Knowledge about a range of places and environments, including their      unique features</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GetSquiggling_Image3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5383" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/GetSquiggling_Image3.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="315" /></a></p>
<p>Both of my kids enjoy watching the program.  It is well pitched for my two year old, but it is my five year old who loves to draw.  A program like <a href="http://www.bbcaustralia.com/cbeebies">Get Squiggling</a> can be a great springboard into other creative activities from which you can reinforce the learning outlined above.  Children can only learn so much by watching – it is in the <strong><em>doing</em></strong> that pathways are formed in the brain, rich language is used in conversation, fine motor skills are developed, and true learning occurs.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas to help you with the <strong><em>doing</em></strong>, after the viewing!</p>
<ul>
<li>Make up some mini-squiggle kits so that the kids can draw easily anywhere.  A small notepad and 4xcrayon pack in a ziploc bag can be kept in your handbag for when you are on the go.  <em>Try: playing a squiggling game! Draw a few lines and encourage your child to turn it into a picture. What could it be? (Ah yes, some of you remember Mr Squiggle…)</em></li>
<li>Provide materials for squiggling outdoors.  Children’s imaginations seem to soar outside!  Give your child a clipboard stocked with paper, and a cup of crayons.  <em>Try: encouraging your child to draw what they see, as well as what they imagine.  Use lots of descriptive language when talking with your child. </em></li>
<li>Think BIG!  <em>Try: using large sheets of butcher’s paper on the floor (or a large box opened out flat) to help your child draw an imaginary world.  “Is there a jungle? Are there rivers?  Who lives in this house?  Don’t fall into the quicksand…!”</em></li>
<li>Squiggle a book together. A simple recount is a great format for young kids and is a valuable language and memory activity.  <em>Try: squiggling about an experience you have (very) recently had together. Write a simple sentence on each page, and encourage your child to illustrate it.  “I went to the shops with Mummy. I saw cornflakes. I saw apples. I saw milk. I saw pizza. I saw lots of trolleys!” </em></li>
<li>Different mediums produce different results.  Provide your child with more than just crayons.  Let them experience pencils, felt pens, chalk, oil pastels, charcoal and more.  <em>Try: drawing on the concrete with chalk.</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/squiggle-kids.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5384" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/squiggle-kids.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="538" /></a></p>
<p><em> </em><em> </em></p>
<p>If followed up with creative opportunities at home, <a href="http://www.bbcaustralia.com/cbeebies">Get Squiggling</a> can be a useful and enjoyable program.</p>
<p><em>SquiggleKids rating: 4 stars. “I like Squiglet. He’s fun and he likes to draw and so do I.  I like how he imagines things and draws whatever he thinks about.” The kids also enjoy singing along with the opening song!</em></p>
<p><em>SquiggleMum rating: 3 stars (when used in conjunction with real opportunities for drawing). I prefer more emphasis on process over product, but the program is enjoyable and it has inspired us to get squiggling together!</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/television2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5329" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/television2.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a question often whispered amongst parents.  We don&#8217;t want to ask out loud for fear of judgment, but most of us admit to using it.  The TV.  The question is&#8230; <em>how much is too much</em>?</p>
<p>I spoke on air recently about screen time.  If you missed it on the radio, you might like to listen to the podcast below:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://squigglemum.com/podcasts/screen_time.mp3">96Five Radio Podcast</a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/965_logo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5327" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/965_logo.png" alt="" width="140" height="95" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p>Here are some of my thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&#8217;m not against television viewing.  In fact, I quite often review children&#8217;s programs here on the blog.  BUT&#8230; I think as parents we should select what we allow our kids to watch, rather than leaving the TV to run.</li>
<li>The maximum time a child should spend looking at a screen is 2hrs a day.  Some new research is suggesting that children under two shouldn&#8217;t watch any television at all.  Keep this in mind especially if you have older children watching while your little one is in the room.</li>
<li>One of the biggest problems with television is what it <em><strong>doesn&#8217;t</strong></em> do.  It doesn&#8217;t converse<a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/television1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5330" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/television1.jpg" alt="" width="252" height="336" /></a> with your child. It doesn&#8217;t improve your child&#8217;s fine or gross motor skills.  It doesn&#8217;t give them hands on experience.  It doesn&#8217;t replace the real world, or real people.  Make sure your child&#8217;s <strong>real </strong>experiences far outweigh their <strong>virtual </strong>ones.</li>
<li>Screen time includes more than TV.  If your child has access to a computer, iPod, iPad, iPhone or other smart phone it all counts towards screen time.  Two hours can pass quickly. It&#8217;s up to parents to monitor and limit use.</li>
<li>Use screen time when it best benefits your routine. For our family, it&#8217;s the late afternoon.  Usually the kids play outside in the afternoon, then they come in for some quiet screen time while I cook dinner.  Saturday mornings are the only mornings the TV is allowed to go on.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p style="text-align: center">

<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been hearing a message I really dislike:  <em>Keep your kids out of the winter weather</em>.  I&#8217;m not sure where the message is coming from, or why.  Of course we have to make allowances for weather, but there is no need to keep kids indoors.  Outdoor play is an important part of a child&#8217;s day &#8211; every day.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago to the day, I wrote here on the blog about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/playing-whatever-the-weather/">Playing Whatever the Weather</a>:</p>
<p><em>I don’t think we can expect children to tolerate extremes of temperature  they are not accustomed to, but I do think they should be able to enjoy  outside time in their home climate.  For my kids, temperatures range  from about 10 degrees celsius in winter, through to around 35 degrees in  summer.  Winter play means wearing lots of layers.  The  days start chilly, but do warm up and beanies need to be replaced with  sunhats.  Winter play doesn’t mean staying inside with the heater on.   Summer play means sunscreen, hats and sun-safe clothing.  It also means  drinking plenty of water, and playing out of the sun during the hottest  times.  Summer play doesn’t mean staying inside with the airconditioning  on!  Ok, yes there are days when I use the heater in winter, and the air  con in summer – but we don’t stay trapped inside and I always find the  kids have more fun outdoors.</em></p>
<p>A year on, I am nodding along to my own words. My opinion hasn&#8217;t changed.  I still think it&#8217;s important for kids to get outside, whatever the weather.  Next week the school holidays start, and I know it will be a great opportunity for my two munchkins to play together outside.  Here&#8217;s what a typical home day in the winter holidays looks like for us (with the morning routine relaxed because we&#8217;re not in a rush to get to school):</p>
<ul>
<li>6:30 &#8211; 7:30 Breakfast</li>
<li>7:30 &#8211; 8:30 Get dressed, brush teeth, make beds, do morning jobs</li>
<li>8:30 &#8211; 9:30 Play inside (or help Mum with housework)</li>
<li>9:30 &#8211; 10:30 Morning tea and <strong>outside free play</strong></li>
<li>10:30 &#8211; 12:00 Creative activity together, preferably <strong>outside </strong>(anything from painting to playing pirates!)</li>
<li>12:00 &#8211; 12:30 Lunch</li>
<li>12:30 &#8211; 1:30 Quiet Time in bedrooms (read or rest)</li>
<li>1:30 &#8211; 3:30 <strong>Outside free play</strong> or continuing activity and afternoon tea</li>
<li>3:30 &#8211; 4:00 Pack up sandpit, outside toys, creative mess</li>
<li>4:00 &#8211; 5:30 Play inside, TV on (while Mum gets dinner ready)</li>
<li>5:30 &#8211; 6:15 Dinner and bathtime</li>
<li>6:15 &#8211; 7:00 Stories and BED</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty fluid schedule &#8211; times are just there to give you an idea. You can see though that the kids can easily have three or four hours outside during the warmest parts of the day.  I know that some days they will have extra time outdoors, because they&#8217;ll be keen to get outside straight after breakfast despite the chill, or because they&#8217;re still hunting for dinosaur eggs at 4:30 and haven&#8217;t noticed the temperature dropping!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind the tv going on in the late afternoons at all.  I know that the kids have had lots of outside time, and they&#8217;ve usually had enough of each other by then.  We&#8217;re all getting tired, crankiness creeps in, and I need to get dinner ready.  And what do I put on? <a href="http://www.madman.com.au/series/home/15601/dirtgirlworld">Dirtgirlworld </a>of course!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.madman.com.au/series/home/15601/dirtgirlworld"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5306" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/dirtgirl_banner.jpg" alt="" width="560" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.madman.com.au/series/home/15601/dirtgirlworld">Dirtgirl </a>knows that winter is wonderful outside.  She loves winter&#8217;s nourishing soups, rugging up in lovely warm clothing and gumboots, and making the most of the sun when it&#8217;s out &#8211; even if it&#8217;s just for a little bit.  Me and Dirtgirl? We&#8217;re <em><strong>so </strong></em>on the same page.  Even when my kids are watching tv, they are getting the message that outside is where the fun is at.  Dirtgirl and Scrapboy give my kids ideas for tomorrow&#8217;s play, and encourage them to get their boots on and head outside all over again.</p>
<p>Thanks to my friend <a href="http://www.madman.com.au/series/home/15601/dirtgirlworld">Dirtgirl </a>(and the gang at Madman) I have five amazing prize packs to give away. Each one has the Winter DVD, as well as Dirtgirlworld&#8217;s Spring, Summer and Autumn DVD collections!  <strong>To win all four seasons DVDs, just leave a comment below sharing what your kids like to do outside in WINTER. </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ukulele_baby.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4863" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/ukulele_baby.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="295" /></a></p>
<p>The ukulele is such a fun instrument.  Its small size makes it ideal for young kids to handle, they are inexpensive (usually around $25) and come in a range of colours.  Of course, the ukulele is more than just a &#8220;toy guitar&#8221; as it is also a serious instrument in its own right.</p>
<p><em><strong><span id="more-4857"></span>Ukulele Baby!</strong></em> is the latest offering from Aussie children&#8217;s superstars The Wiggles, and explores the sound of the ukulele and the feel of music from the caribbean.  The Wiggles have set sail on a  new adventure with the sweet sound of strumming and palm trees in the  distance. Set on an island near Wiggle Bay, The Wiggles have launched  twenty three new songs including soon-to-be-classics like <em>You Can Play the Ukulele</em> and <em>Hula, Hula Baby</em>. The album also features a couple of special guests. The highlight for me is the hilarious revival of a 70&#8217;s kids song, <em>The Good Ship Fabulous Flea! </em>with Rolf Harris.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to my wiggly friends at Roadshow I have FOUR copies of <em>Ukulele Baby!</em> to give away to SquiggleMum readers. To enter, leave a comment sharing who your favourite Wiggle (or Wiggles character) is.</strong> Aussie residents only please. One entry per person. Comp closes Sunday 6/3/11 6pm Qld time.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The latest release from Hi-5 has hit the shelves for January, and thanks to my friends at Roadshow I have THREE copies to give away to SquiggleMum readers. </strong>The album is full of boppy songs, bright colours, great costumes and lots of dancing.  The title track, <em>Happy House</em> makes for a catchy opening, and my kids have been singing this one around the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4ag3IZ9dLE&#038;feature=related</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p style="text-align: left">My favourite track though is <em>Backyard Adventurers</em>. We do a fair bit of backyard adventuring here at our house!  I appreciate songs that encourage kids to get outside. It would be great to see this with footage of kids (or the Hi-5 Team) actually in a backyard and out of the studio!  I&#8217;m still not fussed on a lot of the dialogue. I&#8217;d love to see the Hi-5 team move to more natural sounding language, and speak &#8220;to&#8221; the children rather than &#8220;at&#8221; them.  Still, the album is enjoyable, and my own kids have had fun singing and dancing along with the colourful gang.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left">The Squiggle Report:</h2>
<p><strong>Like </strong>- <em>Happy House</em>, <em>Backyard Adventurers</em>, the girls&#8217; shoes!!</p>
<p><strong>Dislike </strong>- dialogue patronising at times</p>
<p><strong>SquiggleKids rating</strong>: 4/5</p>
<p><strong>SquiggleMum rating</strong>: 3/5</p>
<h2>WIN a copy</h2>
<p>To win a copy of Hi-5&#8217;s latest release <strong>leave a comment below sharing what makes your home a <em>happy house</em></strong>!  Aussie residents only please. One entry per person.  Comp closes 6pm Qld time Sunday 30/1/11 and winners will be drawn at random.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Jimmy Giggle,</p>
<p>We loved meeting up with you when you came to visit Brisbane!!  Thank you for spending some time with us before the signing, and for welcoming us so warmly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jimmy_giggle_welcome.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4413" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jimmy_giggle_welcome.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">We&#8217;re glad you liked the Christmas card we made for you and Hoot. Thanks for taking the time to let us know on facebook (<a href="http://www.facebook.com/ABCForKidsForParents">ABC for Kids &#8211; for Parents page</a>) that Hoot enjoyed our special Christmas bird seed mix too!</p>

<p style="text-align: left">We liked playing with you and seeing your funny button shoes.  (&#8220;Jimmy Shoos&#8221;?!!)  You made us laugh!  Is that why you are called <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/abcforkids/shows/s2948145.htm">Jimmy Giggle</a>?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jimmy_giggle_squigglefamily.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4415" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/jimmy_giggle_squigglefamily.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">There was a very, very big line of kids and mums (and a few dads) waiting to see you.  We know that you stayed for a l-o-n-g time so that no one missed out.  You must really like kids, which is cool &#8211; because kids really like you.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Jimmy Giggle</strong> and <strong>Hoot the Owl</strong> are fast becoming household names in Australia.  The hosts of ABC Kids have just released their first album &#8211;  Beak Bopping Tunes.  To celebrate the release, I had the opportunity to interview James Rees (aka Jimmy Giggle)&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Giggle_gallery_screenshot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4193" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Giggle_gallery_screenshot.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="288" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>Cath </strong>- Congratulations on your success as the host of ABC For Kids.  Other television stations have had hosts for children’s programs for some time. Were you intimidated by the challenge of taking on this role as the face of ABC Kids? </em></p>
<p><em><strong>James </strong>- I would say more nervous than intimidated however I was greeted with the loveliest bunch of people who made me feel so comfortable and still do to this day. I couldn&#8217;t really ask for a better experience at the ABC.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Cath </strong>- Is it true that you didn’t have any television experience before landing the role as Jimmy Giggle? How did you get the gig?! </em></p>
<p><em><strong>James </strong>- Yes that is true. I was involved in theatre and drama throughout my schooling and television was a pipe dream of mine. After spotting an ad in the paper for an audition for new kids presenters on the ABC I sent away a video and a few months later found myself filming the first episode. Crazy!</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Cath </strong>- My kids really enjoy the songs “My Best Friend” and “Five Steps To Bed”.  Which song do you and Hoot most like performing together?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>James </strong>- Well we have a number of new songs that have been released on our new CD and will appear on the show in the not so distant future. We both love the &#8220;Getting to Know You Song&#8221; and a favourite of mine is the new hip hop track on the CD called &#8220;Use Your Words&#8221;.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Cath </strong>- What do your mates think about Jimmy Giggle? Especially those PJs and slippers&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>James </strong>- My friends think the Jimmy Giggle thing is pretty hilarious and they&#8217;ve taken it all on board and secretly really want a pair of PJ for themselves.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Cath </strong>- So what does the future hold for you?  There is already a “<a href="http://www.facebook.com/SquiggleMum#!/pages/We-love-Jimmy-Giggle-James-Rees/133096343406928">We love Jimmy Giggle (James Rees)</a>” Facebook page for all your fans.  What’s next&#8230;?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>James </strong>- Firstly, I have to personally thank all our fans. It&#8217;s very sweet to have people show their support for the show, whether it be on Facebook or via mail. In the future we hope to expand the show to keep it fresh, exciting and most of all fun. Personally, who knows what the future holds, that&#8217;s the exciting part.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Cath </strong>- As always with interviews I like to give my kids the chance to participate, so this is direct from my four year old:  &#8220;I know a lot about birds. What kind of owl is Hoot?  Mum said you are real but Hoot is a puppet.  Is it funny working with a puppet?&#8221;</em></p>
<p><em><strong>James </strong>- Hoot says that he is a &#8216;little blue owl&#8217; and he also said to make sure you are tucked up safe and warm in your bed every night as he flies on the night watch!</em></p>
