				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know that saying, &#8220;One person&#8217;s trash is another person&#8217;s treasure&#8230;&#8221;?!  Never has it been more true.<span id="more-5721"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5722" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I have been scouring second hand shops and sites for a while now, hoping to find a small sink for our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">much-loved dirt kitchen</a>.  So, I was completely delighted to come across this discarded laundry tub recently.  I hadn&#8217;t considered a laundry tub, but the deep single trough is perfect for outdoor <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/water-play/">water play</a>.  I also love the green colour which blends in fantastically with the dirt kitchen and surrounding trees.  (The kids&#8217; needs come first in our playscape, but I&#8217;ll admit I still prefer the back yard not to be an eyesore!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I thought about building a simple wooden structure to support the sink, but the kids were desperate to start using it so I propped it up on some bricks.  I made sure there was enough clearance underneath for the drain to flow freely, and the kids dug their own channel for the water to run out into the yard.  As it turned out, this has worked perfectly &#8211; so the bricks are staying for now!  The sink is tucked away beside the existing dirt kitchen, nestled between the trunks of a few big trees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I&#8217;m pleased to report that the grand total for this project was only a couple of dollars.  Yep, the cost of a plug.  I could have spent a hundred dollars on a fancy plastic water table, but I doubt my munchkins would have any more fun with it than they do with this tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5723" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Please don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking you need to spend big dollars on your children.  Keep your eye out for &#8220;treasures&#8221; and just let your kids be kids outside.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This year I am working hard to improve our backyard, and create a playscape rich in natural opportunities for learning, discovering, playing and growing.</p>
<p>When we added our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/getting-dirty-in-outdoor-kitchens/">Dirt Kitchen</a> to the backyard last year, you might remember that I started training a vine into a roof of sorts.  Here&#8217;s an image of it in August, 2010:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_vine_Aug10.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4608" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_vine_Aug10.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>It was growing so well that it began to weigh the strings down, so I started thinking about ways to prop it up. Then wandering the aisles at <a href="http://www.bunnings.com.au/default.aspx">Bunnings</a> (as you do&#8230;) I found this arch for under $10.  I figured it was worth a try, and it turns out it was perfect for the job. I didn&#8217;t want it to be the full height, so I just left a few pieces off.  Then I went back to Bunnings and bought a second one!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_vine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4610" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_vine.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Look at it now!! With all the rain we&#8217;ve had in Brisbane, most plants have seen rapid growth.  Instead of just a roof, now we have a whole nature cubby growing.  Every day we see new growth, and the kids and I are enjoying winding the tendrils around the arches to create our walls and roof.  That &#8220;<a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/getting-dirty-in-outdoor-kitchens/">shady space</a>&#8221; I said I was dreaming of back in August is looking like a reality &#8211; and all for the grand sum of $20. Bargain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_collage2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4611" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/nature_cubby_collage2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Stay tuned for more posts about our nature cubby, this interesting vine, and the creatures that are making this cubby house their home.</p>
