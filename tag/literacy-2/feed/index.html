				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;right&#8221; way to teach young children to read has been up for debate this week, following NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli&#8217;s announcement that universities will be required to teach phonics to preservice teachers. (See this article via <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/education-minister-orders-universities-to-teach-phonics-or-face-losing-accreditation/story-fni0cx12-1227019125456?nk=05c34a3558a9475e26ca1faa2730345c">The Daily Telegraph</a> for the story).<span id="more-6786"></span></p>
<p>I did my B.Ed in the mid nineties &#8211; and must admit that I learnt very little about <em>phonics</em> in my degree. (<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Although out on prac, I encountered a range of phonics programs adopted by schools.) </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I did however learn a great deal about </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">whole language </em>in my undergrad subjects,<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> and about the constructivist approach to reading instruction which has greatly impacted my teaching. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/teaching-teachers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6796" alt="teaching teachers" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/teaching-teachers.jpg" width="558" height="431" /></a></p>
<p>In my opinion, there shouldn&#8217;t be a <em>phonics</em> vs <em>whole language</em> war, because it isn&#8217;t necessarily either / or. And the truth is, when it comes down to classroom teachers &#8211; there ISN&#8217;T a war. We are all saying the same thing: <strong>our students need both</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Phonics are important. The ability to make sounds from symbols enables the reader to attempt unfamiliar words. But an understanding of whole language is important too because reading is about more than just sounds &#8211; it&#8217;s about making meaning. If you read but don&#8217;t understand, what&#8217;s the point? </span></p>
<p>I threw this topic out to my colleagues and readers (without giving my opinion), and unsurprisingly their comments confirmed my suspicions. Good teachers know that phonics are important. They also know that not all words can be sounded out, and that meaning can lie beyond graphemes. Here are some of their thoughts:</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/readers-thoughts-phonics.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6791" alt="readers thoughts phonics" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/readers-thoughts-phonics.png" width="502" height="508" /></a></p>
<p><strong>So here is my summary:</strong></p>
<p><em>Dear Universities. Please incorporate phonics into undergrad teacher education, but don&#8217;t ditch the great stuff you are already doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Dear Teachers. Please keep being amazing, and continue adapting your methods to suit the needs of your learners. </em></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Dear Goverment. Please be careful what you mandate. Rarely, if ever, is a single methodology better than a multifaceted approach, and we could lose more than we gain.</span></em></p>
<p><em>Dear Parents. Please don&#8217;t get drawn into the media-fuelled, government fed  debate. Just keep reading aloud daily to your kids. It has more impact than you can possibly imagine. </em></p>
<p><strong>Any further thoughts you would like to add&#8230;?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Parents often ask me if they should do any &#8220;school work&#8221; with their kids during the long summer holidays. I think everyone needs a break over the holidays, but keeping up some reading and writing is a really good idea. In addition to reading aloud to your child each night, I suggest helping your child to keep a holiday journal.<span id="more-6657"></span></p>
<p>Lots of learning happens during school holidays, and a journal is a great way of recording some of that learning and gives your kids a <em><strong>reason</strong></em> to write. It&#8217;s also very easy to adapt for different ages of children.</p>
<p>Here are my children&#8217;s journal entries for the same day, following our trip to the <a href="http://australianmuseum.net.au/">Australian Museum</a>. Mr 5 is still an emerging writer, just about to start full time school. Miss 7 is a confident and capable independent writer.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs5.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6658" alt="dinosaurs5" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs5.jpg" width="440" height="586" /></a></p>
<p>(On the holidays I&#8230; <em>saw dinosaurs</em>.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs7.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6659" alt="dinosaurs7" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/dinosaurs7.jpg" width="406" height="542" /></a></p>
<p>(<i>In the holidays I went to the museum and saw dinosaurs. We went with our friends, Izzy and Mitchell. We went to the minerals witch* was my favourite part of the whole museum. My favourite three minerals are amethyst, sulphur and quartz.)</i></p>
<p>As you can see, my kids are at very different stages. Here are some tips for writing journal entries at different stages.</p>
<p><strong>Beginning Writers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One sentence is enough.</li>
<li>Keep the same sentence structure. (On the holidays I&#8230;)</li>
<li>Provide big lines for little hands to write on.</li>
<li>Cut out tickets, brochures, maps, etc to glue in.</li>
<li>All reasonable spelling attempts are acceptable!</li>
<li>Ask your child to read back their sentence aloud.</li>
<li>Give them praise &#8211; young writers need confidence.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Confident Writers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple sentences, using capitals to begin and full stop to end.</li>
<li>Provide lines for writing, and space for illustration.</li>
<li>Encourage use of specific vocabulary, particularly if new (eg amethyst).</li>
<li>Help your child to identify incorrect* spellings. (&#8220;<em>Are there any words you think don&#8217;t look right?</em>&#8221; Miss7 identified &#8220;favourite&#8221; so we fixed it together. She didn&#8217;t notice &#8220;witch&#8221; so I didn&#8217;t mention it.)</li>
<li>Ask your child to read back their recount aloud.</li>
<li>Give your child specific praise (eg <i>I like the way you remembered to use capital letters for your friends&#8217; names).</i></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Have your kids kept a journal these holidays? </strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was so excited to receive a tin of these sweet story cards in the mail. If you haven&#8217;t come across them yet, let me introduce you to <a href="http://thatsmystory.com.au/">That&#8217;s My Story</a> cards.<span id="more-6571"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thats-my-story-set.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6574" alt="thats my story set" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thats-my-story-set-1024x987.jpg" width="604" height="582" /></a></p>
<p>The tin is about the size of your phone and contains a set of glossy story telling cards. Each card has a simple isolated image on a white background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Red cards = character or object</li>
<li>Green cards = setting</li>
<li>Yellow cards = complication</li>
<li>Blue card = conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>Every good story contains these elements, from picture books through to novels. Kids who recognise the basic elements of a story and understand narrative structure usually do much better in formal literacy lessons once they start school.</p>
<p>You can check out the suggested <a href="http://thatsmystory.com.au/pages/gameideas.php">game ideas</a> on the website, but I would keep it simple. <em>&#8220;Once upon a time there was a&#8230; (red card + green card). Suddenly&#8230; (yellow card). Oh no! But then&#8230;(happy ending).&#8221; </em></p>
<p>I think these open ended cards will get a good workout in our family: in the car, at coffee shops, at bedtime. They are also available as <a href="http://thatsmystory.com.au/catalog.php?category=1">foam stickers for bath time</a> story telling! They retail for $16.95 and would make excellent stocking stuffers, or Christmas gifts for little friends.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to Melissa from That&#8217;s My Story I have one set of cards to give away. To enter simply leave a comment below.</strong> Oh, and it&#8217;d be great if you pop over and like their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThatsMYStoryCards">facebook</a> page too. (Entry is open to Australian residents only. One entry per person. Winner drawn at random Friday 6/12/13 8pm NSW time.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The thing my kids like most about helping with the grocery shopping is writing the list before we go. They both write their own list and are responsible for finding those items on our trip. Mr 5 was very proud of his last shopping list &#8211; and I was too. Here is his list. Can you read it?<span id="more-6510"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/early-writing-list1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6512 aligncenter" alt="early writing list" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/early-writing-list1.jpg" width="518" height="687" /></a></p>
<p>His list says bananas, muesli bars, watermelon and butter. You might notice that he has used only consonants and no vowels (a e i o u) at all. This is perfectly normal for an emergent writer and I did not correct his work.</p>
<p>Parents often ask me about how to help their child with early writing attempts. Should you correct their work? Should you give them praise if the word isn&#8217;t right? What should you say when they ask how to spell something? Here&#8217;s my advice.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>In the early stages of learning to write, the focus should be on hearing sounds, identifying sounds, and representing those sounds. If the sounds are correctly identified and represented, the work will be &#8220;readable&#8221; even if an actual word isn&#8217;t written. </strong></span>Here&#8217;s what that looks like in practice:</p>
<p>Mr 5: Watermelon! I want to put watermelon on the list.</p>
<p>Me: Excellent idea. We can get watermelon this week if you write it on your list.</p>
<p>Mr 5: How do I write watermelon?</p>
<p>Me: What can you hear?</p>
<p>Mr 5: <span style="line-height: 1.5;"><em>War-Ta-Me-Lun</em> (four <em>sounds</em>)</span></p>
<p>Me: So what was the first sound?</p>
<p>Mr 5: <em>War</em>-</p>
<p>Me: And how do you write <em>War</em>-?</p>
<p>Mr 5: (draws a W)</p>
<p>Me: Good job! What can you hear next?</p>
<p>Mr 5: <em>War-TA</em>- I can hear a <em>ta</em> and I know how to write a <em>ta</em>!</p>
<p>Me: Great, write it down. You&#8217;ve got <em>wa-ta- </em>what comes next?</p>
<p>Mr 5: <em>War-ta-Mmmmm&#8230; Mm for Mummy. </em></p>
<p>Me: You are such a good writer! Watermelon is a big word to write. Can you hear anything else?</p>
<p>Mr 5: (Whispers to himself <em>Wa-ta-me-</em>) <em>Lllllll</em>. I can hear L.</p>
<p>Me: Well done! Let&#8217;s read your word. (Point to letters written and say corresponding sound) <em>War-Ta-Me-Lun. </em>Watermelon!! Great writing mate.</p>
<p>*   *  *</p>
<p>Here are some things I didn&#8217;t do during our conversation.</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&#8217;t give him any answers. When your child asks how to spell or write a word, ask a question back. &#8220;What can you hear?&#8221; is a good one to start with.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t make him write sounds he didn&#8217;t identify. For example, if I had forced the issue, he probably could have identified the sound <em>Nn</em> at the end of watermelon. At this early stage, identifying 4 sounds in a word is brilliant! No need to push harder.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t add in the vowels. He is still a pre-reader, and has plenty of time yet to learn about what words look like, and what else is needed to make up a sound (<em>t + a = ta</em>). This comes later.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t add in any other sounds he missed. If I had gone back over his list and added everything he left out, he would feel less capable as a writer. Getting the word &#8220;right&#8221; isn&#8217;t the goal of early writing. The goal is to effectively communicate. (Again, &#8220;rightness&#8221; comes later.)</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t correct his handwriting. Sure, he has a mix of upper and lower case letters but at this stage it&#8217;s not a big deal. It&#8217;s best to focus on one thing at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this encourages you as a parent, and helps you to feel more equipped to help your pre-schooler with their emerging writing skills. Writing a shopping list together is a simple, purposeful, and achievable activity.</p>
