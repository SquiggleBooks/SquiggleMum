<p><em></em>As soon as I heard about <strong><em>S</em><em>ylvia,</em> </strong>I couldn&#8217;t wait to get my hands on this delightful picture book. Sylvia the Snail is in love with Simon the Gardener &#8211; or at least his produce. She pines for his parsley and peas, and thinks his spinach and strawberries are scrumptious. Sadly, the feeling is not mutual, at least in the beginning.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sylvia-snail-image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6812" alt="Sylvia snail image" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sylvia-snail-image.jpg" width="591" height="464" /></a></p>
<p>Early childhood educators will love <em><strong>Sylvia</strong></em>. The story ties in nicely with Sustainability (a cross-curricula priority in the Australian Curriculum) and any unit about growth and living things. The text is full of rich vocabulary (<em>luscious, scrumptious, defeated, smitten, persistence, salute&#8230;</em>) and I am a big fan of texts which embrace interesting descriptive language instead of shying away from it. Strong alliteration features throughout, and will be easy for young readers to identify.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The illustrations are delicious, and I especially like the way readers can see above and below the ground. The changing point of view between Sylvia&#8217;s perspective and Simon&#8217;s is very well done, and the juxtaposition of the two perspectives on the opening spread makes for a wonderful beginning. Also worth discussing with students here is the way Sharp has given equal size, and therefore importance, to both characters. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">UQPress always do a great job with their </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/store/images/Hi-RES/teachersnotes/1319/3435.pdf">teacher&#8217;s notes</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, and these ones are well worth downloading (although I would love to see direct links with Outcomes). </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">My only criticism of this picture book is the inclusion of the tiny plane as I would have preferred something more organic in the narrative resolution. It&#8217;s only a small comment though, and doesn&#8217;t stop <em><strong>Sylvia</strong></em> from being an early childhood text I highly recommend. </span></p>
