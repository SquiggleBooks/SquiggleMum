				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have previously shared some thoughts about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">children and risk</a>, both here on the blog and <a href="http://96five.com">on air</a>. And when my daughter knocked herself out by <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">falling while tree climbing</a> &#8211; my opinion was challenged, but ultimately unchanged.</p>
<p>While I am happy to share my perspective as an educator and a mother, I am not a child psychologist myself, so I was delighted to be able to interview <a href="http://www.pathwayshrc.com.au/about-us/professor-paula-barrett/">Dr Paula Barrett</a> about this topic.  Here are her thoughts on the risky business of childhood.<span id="more-6139"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6142" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Yes, my kids are playing with sticks&#8230;!)</p>
<p><strong>Paula, why is it important for children to be allowed to take risks in their play?</strong></p>
<p>There are several reasons but mainly because children learn and gain resilience through challenging experiences. If a child only ever does things within their comfort zone, where they completely understand all the potential outcomes, they don’t learn how to deal with not always achieving the right result or potential disappointment, which is extremely important in later life. Children learn the most when they are challenged.</p>
<p><strong>As parents, how do we know what is reasonable risk, and what is dangerous? </strong></p>
<p>Risk needs to be determined dependant on the particular child and what is developmentally appropriate. For example, a very young child may be able to climb a tree but doesn’t actually yet have the muscle strength for a successful climb – which can result in a dangerous situation. It is very useful to listen to your support networks to help guide you on this, such as grandparents who have great experience and parents with kids of a similar age as they may have dealt with similar situations.  There are also other networks you can rely on who have studied in this area, for example, child care workers, sport coaches etc – they can often make a valuable contribution to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Have today&#8217;s parents become too risk averse?  Why do you think this has happened?</strong></p>
<p>There are so many reasons for this but I think the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents are more isolated when bringing up children than they used to be. Involving your support networks can help you better evaluate risk by including those with experience, like grandparents or parents with kids of similar ages.</li>
<li>There are just so many rules – which are good in that they protect society at large however they can also inhibit children to take risk.</li>
<li>Kids time today is increasingly over-structured with too many scheduled activities &#8211; which minimises the opportunities children to be challenged outside of being told what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should we do to encourage children who are not natural risk takers?</strong></p>
<p>A great way to encourage children who are not natural risk takers is to help them form friendships with children who are.</p>
<p>And, as parents you can reassure them through modelling the behaviour– go outside with them and get involved.  You can try a step plan where you encourage them to face challenging situations in small steps – maybe once a week or once a fortnight, only moving them to the next step when they are ready.  It helps to reward them but not with things that you buy – it is more powerful to dedicate time to something that they love doing e.g. take them to the beach or build a cubby house with them.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any evidence to suggest that encouraging kids to take risks in play might lead to risky behaviour later in life? </strong></p>
<p>No, there is none at all! Children taking risks during play build self-confidence, whereas developing good judgement or self-regulation is another issue all together. Risk taking in adulthood is more about personality and life choices.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The process of making a play tray with a 2 year old, and setting it up for playtime!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 1.  Hammer the wood. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">SquiggleDad helped, of course.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_make2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4873" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_make2.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 2.  Make your purchases.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Green rocks. Small plant. Mini trolley. Happy boy.<span id="more-4872"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_purchase.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4874" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_purchase.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 3.  Arrange the tray.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">We used wooden offcuts, smooth pebbles, sticks and banksias.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_setup.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4875" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_setup.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 4. Invite the locals.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Dinosaurs were the first residents of our play tray.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_residents.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4876" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_residents.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 5. Innovate.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Long pieces of bark make great roads. Dinosaurs out. Trucks in.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_roads.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4877" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_roads.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 6. Enjoy!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">So. Much. Fun.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_fun.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4878" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/play_tray_fun.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Do you have a play tray? </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Do you allow your child to make purchasing decisions?<br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Would you let your two year old use a hammer?!</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Do you think this looks like fun?</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to a recent pupil-free day, my children had the opportunity to have a play date in our backyard with a group of kids of varying ages (from 2 &#8211; 12).  I encouraged them to make cubby houses, and gave them them access to the following materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>one sheet</li>
<li>string</li>
<li>scissors</li>
<li>anything already in the backyard (rocks, sticks, bamboo, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was amazing to watch the kids interact.  The boys and girls naturally split into two &#8220;teams&#8221; and worked to make two separate cubbies.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/girls_cubby2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4142" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/girls_cubby2.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>The Girls</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This cubby was built mainly by a 4 year old and 12 year old who worked together, sharing ideas and workload.  They identified &#8220;areas&#8221; in their cubby such as the storage area, entrance way, living area and even a toilet area!  They decorated their cubby with strips of palm leaves lashed to fabric which hung down over the entrance.  There was even a doorbell!  All over the cubby were labels either written on pieces of cardboard or directly onto rocks.  I especially loved the rocks at the front door (pictured above) welcoming visitors to the Girls&#8217; Cubby House &#8211; with one rock scrawled in the emergent writing of a 4yr old and the other by a 12yr old&#8217;s hand.  Precious.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/boys_cubby1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4144" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/boys_cubby1.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>The Boys</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The boys were brilliant at sourcing materials from their environment.  It was their idea to cut down some bamboo to use, so I showed them how to work the large secateurs safely and then let them chop down what they needed.  It was fantastic to see their careful and intelligent use of the tools.  They stripped the leaves from the bamboo, leaving sturdy sticks which they then used for structures in and around their cubby.  They lashed together a fence to identify the boundaries of their space, and built an impressive teepee shaped entrance way.  The entrance was marked by a bamboo arrow on the ground, and a circle of rocks sourced from the creek bed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*  *  *  *  *</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I was both challenged and encouraged by the differences between the girls&#8217; and boys&#8217; cubby houses.  Sometimes in my desire to give equal opportunities to both boys and girls, I neglect to celebrate the unique differences between them.  Watching these kids served as an excellent reminder.  <em>But best of all, I just loved that for TWO WHOLE HOURS, seven children between the ages of 2 and 12 worked cooperatively, creatively, intelligently, safely, and with minimal adult interference &#8211; without a &#8220;toy&#8221; in sight. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Do your kids have the opportunity to play with children of varying ages?  And have you noticed differences in the ways boys and girls play outdoors?</p>
