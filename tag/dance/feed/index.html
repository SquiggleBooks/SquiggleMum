				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miss 5 went to see the ballet today as a special treat with her Aunty.  The plan was for Mr 3 and I to hang out at the Queensland Museum for the morning &#8211; but it is currently closed for renovations in preparation for the <a href="http://www.southbank.qm.qld.gov.au/Events+and+Exhibitions/Events/2012/01/150th+birthday+celebrations">150th Birthday Party</a> in just over a week.  (There will be cake. Two METRES of cake. You heard it here&#8230;)</p>
<p>So, while the girls were doing this:<span id="more-5831"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/angelina-ballerina.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5832" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/angelina-ballerina.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8230; the Boy and I opted for plan B: a <a href="http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-transport/public-transport/citycat-ferry-services/index.htm">City Cat</a> ride!  It was quite poignant really.  One year ago today, the Brisbane River was a mess. (You can read my posts written during the disaster <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/brisbane-floods-processing-through-play/">here</a> and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/brisbane-floods-the-aftermath/">here</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">A year ago, the CBD was evacuated as rising water inundated the city.  Today it was business as usual, bustling with cars and people.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brisbane-city.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5833" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brisbane-city.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A year ago the sky was grey, and an ominous, eerie feeling loomed in the air.  As more reports from Grantham, Toowoomba, and other areas came to light, a rising sense of panic was palpable in the inner Brisbane suburbs.  Today the sky was big and blue and full of hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brisbane-river2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5834" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brisbane-river2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="597" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A year ago, a &#8220;mud army&#8221; of over 20, 000 Brissy locals turned out with gumboots and shovels to help those in need.  Talk about community spirit!  A year ago, there wasn&#8217;t a whole lot to smile about.  Today we were all smiles&#8230; <em><strong>especially</strong></em> when the Captain invited the kids on board to help him drive the boat!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We got to go up into the cabin, steer the big silver wheel, sit in the Captain&#8217;s seat and check out all the buttons and levers.  Captain Jack answered all of the kids&#8217; questions happily, including my son asking &#8220;<em>How do we go F-A-S-T?!</em>&#8221;   It was such a wonderful, unexpected experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/citycat-captain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5835" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/citycat-captain.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A year ago, the Brisbane River was a disaster.  <strong>Today, it was an absolute delight.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do your children like to dance? Mine do.  This morning we twirled and whirled in tutus together &#8211; yes, I put one on too.  My daughter asked for &#8220;dancing music&#8221; so I flicked through the CD collection until I settled on one.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/ukulele-baby-wiggle-squiggle-giveaway/">The Wiggles</a>, even though Dorothy rather considers herself a dino-ballerina.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/justine-clarke-in-concert/">Justine Clarke</a>, even though she&#8217;s hands down my favourite children&#8217;s entertainer.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose a Playschool album, or a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/dear-jimmy-giggle/">Jimmy Giggle</a> album, or any other children&#8217;s album.</p>
<p>So what DID I choose?<span id="more-5088"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5090" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing4.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><em>Haydn, Rimsky-Korsakov, Schubert, Tchaikovsky </em>and <em>Grieg</em>.  Yes, classical orchestral music by some of the world&#8217;s best composers.  Despite my love for good qualitychildren&#8217;s music, I fear that at times we do our kids a disservice by not exposing them to music beyond this.  It is valuable for little ears to hear different sounds from different places and different times.  Rock music, classical music, folk music, jazz music, choral music and more.  (Of course there is much adult music that is inappropriate for children so you may need to check any lyrics before you push play!)</p>
<p>I spent many hours rehearsing and playing in orchestras myself as a child and as a teenager, and I still enjoy cranking up the volume of a great piece every now and then.  I can&#8217;t expect my kids to enjoy classical, or jazz (which I also love) with me if I never give them the opportunity to listen to it.  Or dance to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5091" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing_collage.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="304" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Which genres of music do you enjoy, </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>and do your kids listen, sing or dance along too?</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure who came up with the idea of ribbon sticks. Red Ribbon Dances were performed for Chinese Royalty thousands of years ago, but I suspect ribbon sticks have a heritage in more than one culture. Ribbon dancing still has a place today in contemporary gymnastics.</p>
<p>Wherever they have come from, there is something beautiful and creative about playing with ribbon sticks. At a time when hi-tech toys rule the toybox, it&#8217;s delightful to see children playing with such a simple object.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ribbon_stick.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4749" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ribbon_stick.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 1: Collect a bunch of ribbons.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 2: Tie the bunch with a piece of ribbon. Leave long ends on the tying ribbon.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 3: Wrap the tying ribbon ends around the stick, securing the bunch to the stick.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Step 4: Play. Dance. Swoosh. Twirl. Dream. Fly.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ribbon_stick_boy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4750" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ribbon_stick_boy.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>

<p>Have you made ribbon sticks with your children? I know the <a href="http://www.playbasedlearning.com.au/2010/09/ribbon-sticks/">Irresistible Ideas</a> ladies have made them with their preschoolers. I&#8217;d love to hear if you have too!  Do you prefer them inside, or out? Do your children dance with or without music?</p>
