				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><em>New state, new city, new suburb.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>New house, new yard, new neighbourhood.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>New school, new church, new shopping centre.<span id="more-6310"></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/garie-beach.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6315" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/garie-beach.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Garie Beach, <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Royal-National-Park">Royal National Park</a>, NSW)</p>
<p>New things are exciting, but also a little unsettling. And when almost everything in your world is new, life can be very unsettled. I&#8217;m discovering that both holding on to the old, and embracing the new, are important elements in establishing life in a new place. Here are some things I&#8217;ve been doing to help my kids with the transition:</p>
<p>1.  Holding on to the old:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beds</strong>. Same beds, same sheets, same pjs. There&#8217;s something incredibly normalising about sleeping in your own bed.</li>
<li><strong>Routine</strong>. The same morning <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/routine-charts-for-easy-starts/">routine</a> chart that was on the fridge in Brisbane, is still on the fridge in Sydney. It&#8217;s business as usual on school mornings&#8230; make bed, uniform on, breakfast, teeth brushing, hair done, unstack dishwasher, pack bag. The uniforms might be different, but nothing else has changed there.</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>. Holding on to special friendships is important. Miss 7 has put framed photographs of her friends in pride of place in her bedroom. She has also sent a few text messages on my phone, and started some letter writing.</li>
</ul>
<div>2.  Embracing the new:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outdoor play</strong>. Our new yard is very different from the backyard the kids knew and loved in <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/goodbye-brisbane/">Brisbane</a>. For the first time ever, we have a flat patch of grass &#8211; so we bought a trampoline! Some serious jumping is great for warming up chilly little bodies who are used to a warmer climate.</li>
<li><strong>Exploring</strong>. Sydney is a beautiful part of the world. The city is big and busy, but away from the traffic there are rivers, bays, beaches and bushland to explore. While our family has some space from weekend commitments and after school activities, we are happily exploring <a href="http://www.sutherlandshireaustralia.com.au/">Sutherland Shire</a> where we now call home. (Pic above is in nearby <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Royal-National-Park">Royal National Park</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>. &#8220;Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, the other gold.&#8221; Making new friends is important in feeling like you belong in a place. As I encourage the kids to introduce themselves to other children, I am also endeavouring to lead by example and be proactive about meeting other mums myself.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Moving interstate with a young family is a big deal. It&#8217;s early days yet, but so far so good&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://livinglocurto.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5904" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Morning_cards-livinglocurto.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><em></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The start of the day can be harrowing, especially if you have kids of different ages who need to get to different places!  The only way I know of getting everyone out of the door on time and with everything they need, is to establish good routines and stick to them.  Routine charts can be incredibly helpful for a child&#8217;s growing independence.  Young kids who can manage a few steps independently in the morning, become kids who are responsible for their own school materials, and then become teens who are capable of managing their own timetables.</p>
<p><span id="more-5901"></span></p>
<p>I chatted with Liam, Robbie and Jo on air this morning about routine charts on Brisbane&#8217;s 96Five.  If you missed it, check out the <a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=11331">podcast</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=11331"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5902" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/96five.gif" alt="" width="223" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Summary points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t confuse reward charts with routine charts</li>
<li>Move from photographs, to pictorial symbols, to words and symbols, then finally to timetables</li>
<li>Keep it age appropriate (a 4 year old can probably manage a 4 step morning routine&#8230; a 6 year old can manage 6 steps)</li>
<li>Remember that the aim is independence! Let them be responsible for their tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three ways to go about starting off a new routine chart for your child.  You can make it yourself from scratch, use one that others find works for them, or buy a ready-made one.  The advantage of making your own is that you can truly personalise it for your child.  Photos are especially effective for young kids.  Take a photo of the breakfast cereal, the kindy bag, the school uniform, the sunscreen&#8230; whatever!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to use a routine chart from other mums, try one of these:</p>
<p><a href="http://childhood101.com/2011/06/literacy-spot-24-routines-with-free-printable-picture-cards/">Childhood101</a> &#8211; I highly recommend Christie&#8217;s FREE printable routine cards for young kids. Photos ready to go!</p>

<p><a href="http://theorganisedhousewife.com.au/printables/kids-charts/">The Organised Housewife</a> &#8211; Print out Katrina&#8217;s FREE morning or evening routine chart for primary school kids.</p>
<p><a href="http://getbuttonedup.com/2011/11/03/tool-free-printable-kids-schedule-sheet/">Buttoned Up</a> &#8211; Try this FREE weekly schedule for kids in middle school. Laminate it, then fill it out together at the start of each week with a fine whiteboard marker.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.littlebillies.net/">Little Billies</a> &#8211; I <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/little-billies-giveaway/">reviewed these charts a couple of years ago</a> but sadly they are no longer available <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pwk-leaderboard-480X60.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pwk-leaderboard-480X60.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="60" /></a></p>
<p>I often describe my life  as organised chaos. I&#8217;m a too-busy mama with too many to-do lists and not enough hours in the day!  Sometimes the result is a big, full, happy, satisfying week.  At other times though, the result is a frazzled mother, cranky kids and a messy home.  I&#8217;m always inspired by other women who are still busy, yet manage to calm the chaos.<span id="more-5042"></span> Nicole Avery is one of those women.  She is a spreadsheet queen, mum of five,well known blogger and now author! Yes, the <a href="http://planningwithkids.com">Planning With Kids</a> blog is now a book.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Planning-with-Kids-Front-Cover-500-x-754.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5262" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Planning-with-Kids-Front-Cover-500-x-754.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>The book  is full of advice, suggestions, and tried-and-true ideas.  In addition to her own thoughts, Nicole has included quotes from mums and mummy-bloggers all over the country. Yours truly is featured in Part I (p4) in the chapter on <strong>Routines </strong>and their importance in family life.  I am NOT, however, offering any advice in the following chapters meal planning, or spreadsheeting your family finances!</p>
<p>Part II contains great common-sense advice for babies, toddlers, preschoolers and school aged children. I enjoyed reading this section and found myself nodding along much of the way.  I also picked up some wonderful tips from Nicole, and from the other quoted mums with children a little older than mine. There is always something we can learn from those who have gone before us.</p>
<p>Part III is about prioritising yourself, and your relationship with your husband (or partner).  Nic sets ten personal goals for herself every year, and holds herself accountable to them too! She also makes time each week to go to the gym, spend time blogging, and even schedules a Sunday sleep in.  She also has some really worthwhile advice to share about keeping your marriage strong while raising kids.  Part IV is all about family fun!  <strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Nicole-Avery-Planning-Queen-200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5264 alignright" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Nicole-Avery-Planning-Queen-200.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="160" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>This Friday, 10th June, Nicole is flying up from Melbourne to my sunny home town of Brisbane. She will be appearing at Westfield Chermside, 10am at Dymocks, to sign copies of her book. </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I know she would love to meet lots of her Brissy readers and it would be great to see you there.  We won&#8217;t be hard to find. She&#8217;ll be the one sitting at an organised desk with copies of her book, spare pens, bloggy business cards in one pocket and bandaids in the other. I&#8217;ll be the one beside her with frazzled hair&#8230;</p>
