				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last month has been challenging journey for our little family through some ups and downs.</p>
<p>One of us came down with the flu, just as the other recovered.</p>
<p>One of us flew away from Brisbane, just as the other returned.</p>
<p>One family said hello to us, just as we say goodbye to another.</p>
<p>One friend welcomed a new baby, while heartbreakingly another will bury hers this week.<span id="more-5686"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mountain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5687" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mountain.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">When the going gets tough, priorities are stripped back to the barest essentials.  Social media seems unimportant when friends nearby desperately need a meal.  Keeping up with my reader comes second to keeping up with the housework.  And when we need to spend time as a family, talking about the big things of life and processing our feelings &#8211; the blog and everything else can wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I value my readers highly, and I love sharing with you all, but the truth is that you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> me.  My children and my husband, and close friends do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I didn&#8217;t start this post with, &#8220;<em>Sorry I haven&#8217;t blogged for a while&#8230;&#8221;</em> and I never will.  I&#8217;m not sorry.  Prioritising my family is the right thing to do.  I cannot possibly blog, speak or write with integrity about parenting if I don&#8217;t practise what I preach!  So please bear with me during the times I am less active online.  It simply means I am doing double-time offline; nurturing, loving and caring for those who truly need me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">And I know you understand that.</p>
