				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">This week I received a bittersweet letter from </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.compassion.com.au/index.php">Compassion Australia</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, letting us know that the child we have sponsored for many years no longer requires our financial support. She is now 15, and while we are so pleased her family in Indonesia is finally doing well financially, we are also sad as she has been an important part of our own family. Her photo has always been on the fridge alongside our own children&#8217;s school photos.<span id="more-6595"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.compassion.com.au/banner.php?intid=99&amp;strkey=97915ea0-66e6-11e3-b0a1-005056b06a0e" height="250" width="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>When we told the kids that we would be sponsoring a new child, we were surprised at their response. Both had instant and very strong feelings, and put forward their opinions without being asked. Mr 5 said, &#8220;Thailand. I think we should sponsor a child from Thailand Mummy. That is a poor country you know.&#8221; (How does he know anything about Thailand?!) Miss 7 said, &#8220;We really should choose a young child. If we sponsor a young child, we can have a big impact on their life Mum.&#8221; Wise words from someone still so young herself.</p>
<p><strong>So today I called Compassion. I found myself all choked up on the phone as I requested that we sponsor a young, needy child in Thailand. I don&#8217;t cry easily, and almost never in front of strangers, so it caught me a little off guard. </strong></p>
<p>I think my emotional reaction comes from the fact that God put the child we should sponsor onto the hearts of my own kids &#8211; and they were in tune with Him enough to listen. We sponsor because of the immeasurable impact it has on a child we will never meet, but the truth is that it has an impact on our children too.</p>
<p>We might not be rich by Sydney-standards, but we certainly are wealthy when compared to poverty stricken families. This Christmas, somewhere in Thailand is a three year old boy whose life will change, simply because we said yes to Compassion. And his mother probably has tears in her eyes too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word &#8220;home&#8221; has been on my mind a lot these past few weeks. What is home?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Home-wifi-squigglemum.png"><img class="wp-image-6468 aligncenter" alt="Home wifi squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Home-wifi-squigglemum-682x1024.png" width="434" height="653" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Home is a roof overhead</strong>. At least in the short term, <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/mums/hello-sydney/">&#8220;home&#8221; for us in Sydney</a> is a rental house. To be honest I feel unsettled living in a rented property. The house is lovely, and I am so grateful for it, but making it feel like it&#8217;s <em><strong>ours</strong></em> is challenging. <span id="more-6467"></span>No repainting feature walls, or hanging pictures where ever I like, and certainly no demolition of any kind! What I can do though is surround us with familiarity. I can put familiar faces on the fridge, I can put familiar cushions on the couch, and I can bake familiar things in the oven. (Actually, I haven&#8217;t quite worked out my oven here yet&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Home is where ever we&#8217;re together</strong>. Cliched, I know. It&#8217;s funny how true it is though when you relocate a family. There are <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/activities/goodbye-brisbane/">things I miss about Brisbane</a>, but I&#8217;m not &#8220;homesick&#8221; because we&#8217;re here together. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">At the end of the day, it&#8217;s the togetherness that matters most. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">And the things that I do miss aren&#8217;t things anyway &#8211; they are people. I have wonderful friends in Brissy, and around the world, who will still be my friends no matter how far apart we are. A big move gives you a real perspective shift. </span></p>
<p><strong>Home is eternal</strong>. As a Christian, I also believe I have a forever-home in heaven and I need to remind myself that nothing here on earth is permanent. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">As I wrestle with the question of what home is, t</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">he unsettled feeling in my soul is probably good for me. My eyes should be fixed on something far greater than a nice house and a nice life. </span></p>
<p><strong>So what is home for you? Home is&#8230; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; while I&#8217;m on the topic of home, you might notice that my blog-home has been given a makeover too! It&#8217;s a cleaner, simpler design that is mobile friendly. Hope you like. Cath x</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After church my six year old asked the question &#8211; &#8220;Mum, what does three in one mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>I took a deep breath before launching into my answer.  Despite the fact that I&#8217;ve been a Christian for most of my life, there are still some things I find hard to get my head around.  (There will probably always be things I can&#8217;t get my head around when it comes to God, because He&#8217;s God. And I&#8217;m not.)<span id="more-6102"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/three-rings.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6103" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/three-rings.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="358" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">So, as best I could I talked to her about God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  The Bible is clear that they are all God, three in one.  My daughter looked confused (understandably), so I talked some more, using the example of three interconnected rings, or a three strand rope.  She still looked puzzled, and I feared I was confusing her more than helping her.  After all, it is a concept hard to fully grasp myself as an adult.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Instead of trying to give her the answers I thought she wanted, I asked if she had any questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8220;Mum,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t asking about God. I was just wondering about that coffee stuff in the kitchen&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nescafe-box.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6104" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nescafe-box.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="194" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Note to self: </strong>don&#8217;t over think it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PS &#8211; this isn&#8217;t the Faith post I had planned for this month, but I had to share <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I look like I&#8217;ve got life sorted.</p>
<p>But the truth is, most of the time, I&#8217;m not so together.<span id="more-6064"></span></p>
<p>The kids aren&#8217;t always happy. The bickies aren&#8217;t always home-baked. The floors aren&#8217;t always swept.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s highly likely I can&#8217;t find my keys, or my phone, or my shoes, or my brain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know that God doesn&#8217;t need me to be perfect.</p>
<p>In fact &#8211; He often uses my weaknesses more than my strengths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>This song by Christian artist and young mum <a href="http://www.francescamusic.com/">Francesca Battistelli</a> always puts a smile on my face and reminds me to get some perspective. After all, it&#8217;s not the end of the world!  </em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have talked a lot about life and death in our home over the last week.  It&#8217;s a heavy topic, but circumstances meant discussing death was unavoidable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6026" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing that happened was that a young mum from our church passed away.  The kids understandably had some questions&#8230;<span id="more-5996"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mummy why are you sad?</li>
<li>What is a funeral?</li>
<li>What happens when people die?</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>I&#8217;m crying because a very sad thing happened -everybody cries sometimes.  A funeral is like a special church service where thank God for someone&#8217;s life, and celebrate what was wonderful about them even though we are sad.  And I believe that when we die, those who have accepted Jesus live forever with Him. </em></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6022" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The second thing that happened was that two of our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finch-love/">Gouldian Finch</a> eggs hatched.  The pair had been sitting on four tiny eggs.  Unfortunately a common behaviour of Gouldians is to &#8220;pitch&#8221; their young.  For a range of reasons, the parents toss their own chicks out of the nest.  Sadly our finches pitched their two chicks, and despite our attempts to return them to the nest, we were unable to save them.  The other two eggs did not hatch.  Again, the kids had questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did they throw their babies?</li>
<li>Why didn&#8217;t the other eggs hatch?</li>
<li>Should we bury them?</li>
<li>Why is nature so unfair?</li>
<li>Why do some creatures live and some die?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It is unfair, isn&#8217;t it? Sometimes Gouldians pitch their young because the chicks aren&#8217;t healthy, and sometimes because they just aren&#8217;t ready to be parents yet.  (Aren&#8217;t you glad I&#8217;m not a Mummy Finch?! I would never pitch you.)  I don&#8217;t know why the other two eggs didn&#8217;t hatch. Perhaps they didn&#8217;t grow properly inside, or maybe the parents didn&#8217;t keep them warm enough.  It&#8217;s hard to understand, but it&#8217;s important to remember that everything that lives &#8211; dies one day.  Yes, we can bury them together.  Let&#8217;s dig a little hole&#8230; </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6029" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>And thirdly, this weekend is Easter.  Today is Good Friday, the day we reflect on Jesus&#8217; death on the cross.  Sunday is coming, the day we celebrate His resurrection.  And the kids have questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why isn&#8217;t it called Bad Friday?</li>
<li>Why did Jesus die?</li>
<li>When can we have Easter eggs?!</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It does seem like a funny name because bad stuff happened and it was really sad when Jesus died on the cross.  But we call it Good Friday because it was good that Jesus came, good that He did all the things God sent Him to do, and good because the job was finished on the cross.  Jesus died for us so that we can all have new life.  Today we eat hot cross buns to remind us of the cross, and on Sunday, we&#8217;ll eat Easter eggs because eggs remind us of new life!</em></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jeremiah 29:11 is a well known and much loved Bible verse, and it&#8217;s been on my heart this week.  You see, all of <em>my plans</em> have gone out the window, and God&#8217;s plan has fallen into place in a remarkable way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">When things go right, some people say that &#8220;the planets have aligned.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Others say things are an &#8220;amazing coincidence&#8221;</p>

<p>In a couple of weeks I will be returning the work force in a part-time capacity.  I wasn&#8217;t actively looking for a job. The job found me, and the process has been incredibly smooth.  It&#8217;s a <em>great</em> job working with families and picture books (two of my favourite things).  I&#8217;m delighted to be able to promote the importance of reading in the early years throughout the community.  I&#8217;ll fill you in on more of the job details soon.</p>
<p>The thing is, this wasn&#8217;t my plan. <em>My plan</em> was to do a bit of supply teaching, or return to the classroom in a year or two when my youngest reaches school age too.  I like making my own plans. I like to feel in control.  But if I&#8217;d stuck with <em>my plan</em>, I would have missed this wonderful opportunity!</p>
<p><em>His plan</em> fills me with hope for the future.  <em>His plan</em> is good.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Mummy, my prayer didn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>My five year old was both cross and confused.  She had asked God for the rain to stop so that she and her friends could play in the big playground at school (a new novelty for the Grade One kids), but the wet weather persisted.  If anything, the rain got heavier as the week went on!<span id="more-5889"></span></p>
<p>It was a teachable moment &#8211; a perfect opportunity to talk about prayer.  With kids I often use the phrase, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk to God&#8221; instead of &#8220;Let&#8217;s pray&#8221; because it puts prayer in a context they can understand.  Prayer is a conversation with God.  And conversations don&#8217;t usually go well when one person tells the other what they want, and then gets cranky when things don&#8217;t go their way!</p>
<p>In words she could understand, I explained to my daughter that prayer isn&#8217;t a magic button you can push to guarantee an outcome you desire.  Sure, you can talk to God about anything you like.  I believe He hears.  I believe He can, and <em>does</em> answer prayers.  But sometimes when we ask God for something His answer is no, or not yet.  That&#8217;s the hard bit.  Sometimes we pray about really big, really important things &#8211; and God still says no, or not yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>I have to admit that there&#8217;s a challenge there for me too.  Too often I pray like a child, asking for what I want and only seeing things from my own narrow perspective.  Too often I&#8217;m the one who treats prayer as a magic button.  Too often I forget that prayer is a conversation, which requires me to listen and not just talk!</p>
<p>I love sharing my faith with the kids. It&#8217;s a privilege, but it&#8217;s also a responsibility.  The challenge is to keep maturing in my own faith.  I don&#8217;t have to have all the answers, but I do need to continue growing in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances&#8230; </strong>(1 Thess 5:16-18)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the Christmas break our little family enjoyed a week away at Coffs Harbour.  The kids and I particularly enjoyed the time we spent on the beach together (while SquiggleDad was sleeping in!)  We collected shells and pebbles, built sandcastles, explored the rocks, watched birds, and chased waves.  I grabbed a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; to spontaneously talk to the kids about God too&#8230;<span id="more-5783"></span></p>

<p>A couple of Bible verses to look up at home:</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><span>&#8220;&#8230;with God all things are possible.” (Matthew 19:26 NIV)</span></p>
