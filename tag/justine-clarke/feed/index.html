		<description><![CDATA[Win tix to Justine Clarke's Pop Up Tour!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years as  blogger I have been able to work with some wonderful children&#8217;s authors and artists. One of my favourites is<a href="http://justineclarke.com.au"> Justine Clarke</a>, and I am always delighted to promote her music and concerts. <strong>This year I have TWO DOUBLE PASSES to her upcoming Pop Up Tour to give away to SquiggleMum readers. </strong>(Thanks Justine!)</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why I&#8217;m a fan:</p>
<p><span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/justine_clarke_brisconcert.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3731" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/justine_clarke_brisconcert.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>She&#8217;s Australian</strong>. Sure, there are wonderful artists overseas as well &#8211; but I appreciate the Aussie accent and Aussie content in her work. When my kids sing along, they aren&#8217;t singing about zeeeebras or wellies <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
<li><strong>She writes great songs!</strong>  I have heard so many other mums say that if they HAVE to have kids music playing in the car, they would rather it be Justine Clarke than anyone else. I have previously shared some thoughts about her music <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/top-songs-by-justine-clarke/">here</a> and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/top-songs-by-justine-clarke/">here</a> and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-interview-dvd-giveaway/">here</a>.  Oh, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-great-big-giveaway/">here</a>. Her music isn&#8217;t dumbed down for kids. It&#8217;s sophisticated musically while still being age appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>She performs &#8220;real&#8221; concerts</strong>. I enjoy seeing a real artist performing with real musicians, and I think kids do too.  Her setup is never OTT, and it doesn&#8217;t need to be because the music speaks for itself.  A live gig is a new experience for most kids.</li>
<li><strong>She cares about her little fans</strong>. She might walk the red carpet and receive nominations for acting awards, but she is never too busy for her little fans.  I&#8217;ve seen her stick around for a long time after shows to meet little ones, pose for endless photos, and accept lovingly drawn pictures of The Gumtree Family.</li>
<li><strong>She&#8217;s a mum</strong>. Just like us, she juggles her dreams with raising her kids.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_rainbow_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5427" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_rainbow_collage.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>My kids are huge fans of Justine Clarke, and I am a big supporter of her work as an Australian children&#8217;s entertainer.  I&#8217;ve met her <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/justine-clarke-in-concert/">backstage</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-interview-dvd-giveaway/">interviewed </a>her, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-great-big-giveaway/">reviewed and given away</a> her albums and dvds&#8230; <strong>and now I am delighted to be able to give away tickets to her <em>Little Day Out</em> Tour!</strong> I have TWO double-passes for a couple of lucky SquiggleMum readers.<span id="more-5420"></span></p>
<p>In order to win a pair of tickets, simply share your favourite Justine song!  Do <span style="text-decoration: line-through">you</span> your kids have a favourite?  I couldn&#8217;t pick between my top 3 songs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_colours.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5428" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_colours-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" /></a>Mrs Knife and Mr Fork</em> &#8211; One of my early faves.  For a children&#8217;s  song, the lyrics are just sublime.  Justine rocks a fifties vibe in the  film clip, and there&#8217;s lots of cool percussion played on cutlery.</li>
<li><em>Song to Make You Smile</em> &#8211; This song really does make me smile, and I sing it to the kids to make them smile too.  It has such a sweet melodic introduction, with a catchy chorus and positive message.</li>
<li><em>My Shadow and Me</em> &#8211; I loved this jazz number the first time I heard it, and I never tire of it.  Justine and her team really do set the standard when it comes to creating musically sophisticated, yet age appropriate for our kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>So over to you. Do you agree with my choices, or have a different favourite?<strong> Leave a comment sharing your favourite Justine Clarke song and you could win a double pass to the nearest venue (Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane)!</strong></p>
<p><em>One entry per person please, and you must be able to get to either the Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane show.  Two winners will be chosen at random.  Competition closes 8pm Qld time, Sunday 7/8/11.</em></p>
<p>Justine would love you to visit her <a href="http://www.facebook.com/JustineLikesToSing">facebook page</a>, or stop by her <a href="http://justineclarke.com.au/">website</a> for updates and info.</p>
