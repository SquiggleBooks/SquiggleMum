				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have talked a lot about life and death in our home over the last week.  It&#8217;s a heavy topic, but circumstances meant discussing death was unavoidable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6026" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing that happened was that a young mum from our church passed away.  The kids understandably had some questions&#8230;<span id="more-5996"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mummy why are you sad?</li>
<li>What is a funeral?</li>
<li>What happens when people die?</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>I&#8217;m crying because a very sad thing happened -everybody cries sometimes.  A funeral is like a special church service where thank God for someone&#8217;s life, and celebrate what was wonderful about them even though we are sad.  And I believe that when we die, those who have accepted Jesus live forever with Him. </em></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6022" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The second thing that happened was that two of our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finch-love/">Gouldian Finch</a> eggs hatched.  The pair had been sitting on four tiny eggs.  Unfortunately a common behaviour of Gouldians is to &#8220;pitch&#8221; their young.  For a range of reasons, the parents toss their own chicks out of the nest.  Sadly our finches pitched their two chicks, and despite our attempts to return them to the nest, we were unable to save them.  The other two eggs did not hatch.  Again, the kids had questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did they throw their babies?</li>
<li>Why didn&#8217;t the other eggs hatch?</li>
<li>Should we bury them?</li>
<li>Why is nature so unfair?</li>
<li>Why do some creatures live and some die?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It is unfair, isn&#8217;t it? Sometimes Gouldians pitch their young because the chicks aren&#8217;t healthy, and sometimes because they just aren&#8217;t ready to be parents yet.  (Aren&#8217;t you glad I&#8217;m not a Mummy Finch?! I would never pitch you.)  I don&#8217;t know why the other two eggs didn&#8217;t hatch. Perhaps they didn&#8217;t grow properly inside, or maybe the parents didn&#8217;t keep them warm enough.  It&#8217;s hard to understand, but it&#8217;s important to remember that everything that lives &#8211; dies one day.  Yes, we can bury them together.  Let&#8217;s dig a little hole&#8230; </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6029" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>And thirdly, this weekend is Easter.  Today is Good Friday, the day we reflect on Jesus&#8217; death on the cross.  Sunday is coming, the day we celebrate His resurrection.  And the kids have questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why isn&#8217;t it called Bad Friday?</li>
<li>Why did Jesus die?</li>
<li>When can we have Easter eggs?!</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It does seem like a funny name because bad stuff happened and it was really sad when Jesus died on the cross.  But we call it Good Friday because it was good that Jesus came, good that He did all the things God sent Him to do, and good because the job was finished on the cross.  Jesus died for us so that we can all have new life.  Today we eat hot cross buns to remind us of the cross, and on Sunday, we&#8217;ll eat Easter eggs because eggs remind us of new life!</em></div>
