<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Mummy, my prayer didn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>My five year old was both cross and confused.  She had asked God for the rain to stop so that she and her friends could play in the big playground at school (a new novelty for the Grade One kids), but the wet weather persisted.  If anything, the rain got heavier as the week went on!<span id="more-5889"></span></p>
<p>It was a teachable moment &#8211; a perfect opportunity to talk about prayer.  With kids I often use the phrase, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk to God&#8221; instead of &#8220;Let&#8217;s pray&#8221; because it puts prayer in a context they can understand.  Prayer is a conversation with God.  And conversations don&#8217;t usually go well when one person tells the other what they want, and then gets cranky when things don&#8217;t go their way!</p>
<p>In words she could understand, I explained to my daughter that prayer isn&#8217;t a magic button you can push to guarantee an outcome you desire.  Sure, you can talk to God about anything you like.  I believe He hears.  I believe He can, and <em>does</em> answer prayers.  But sometimes when we ask God for something His answer is no, or not yet.  That&#8217;s the hard bit.  Sometimes we pray about really big, really important things &#8211; and God still says no, or not yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>I have to admit that there&#8217;s a challenge there for me too.  Too often I pray like a child, asking for what I want and only seeing things from my own narrow perspective.  Too often I&#8217;m the one who treats prayer as a magic button.  Too often I forget that prayer is a conversation, which requires me to listen and not just talk!</p>
<p>I love sharing my faith with the kids. It&#8217;s a privilege, but it&#8217;s also a responsibility.  The challenge is to keep maturing in my own faith.  I don&#8217;t have to have all the answers, but I do need to continue growing in God.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the South-East part of the state recovers and rebuilds following <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/brisbane-floods-the-aftermath/">the floods</a>, the North and Far-North Queensland communities are bracing for the most severe cyclone we have ever seen.  Tropical Cyclone Yasi will hit tonight.  Schools have been closed for the rest of the week.  Hospitals have been evacuated.  Airports shut. Roads closed. Thousands and thousands of residents told to flee. This is a very, very serious storm.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cyclone_feb2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4760" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/cyclone_feb2.jpg" alt="" width="514" height="402" /></a></p>

<p>There is likely to be extensive coverage on television networks for the next 48 hours, possibly longer (particularly in Qld).  Here are some things I learned about the coverage of a natural disaster during the recent floods:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be <strong>incessant</strong>.  Expect rolling coverage, and the cancellation of regular programming (including children&#8217;s shows).</li>
<li>It will be <strong>emotional</strong>.  Footage will show real people dealing with real feelings.</li>
<li>It will be <strong>traumatic</strong>.  Homes will be destroyed, and lives may be lost.</li>
<li>It will be <strong>dramatic</strong>.  In case a natural disaster isn&#8217;t dramatic enough on its own, you can be sure the footage will include carefully selected songs, slow motion scenes, soft focus tear-stained faces and images of precious possessions amid rubble.</li>
</ul>
<p>My message to you is to protect your children from <em>some </em>of the media storm if they are not directly affected.  It is up to us to expose our children to enough so that they understand what is happening at an <strong>age-appropriate</strong> level, yet protect them from some of the dramatic footage which they are not emotionally ready to deal with.  As I said with the last <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/brisbane-floods-processing-through-play/">natural disaster</a> in my state:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>As parents, we have a responsibility to walk our children  through times like this – and it isn’t always easy.  Their questions  need to be acknowledged, even if we can’t give them answers.  We have to  <em>know</em> our kids.  Really <em>know them</em>, in order to help  them make sense of the world around them. We have to know how much  information they can comprehend.  We have to know how sensitive they  are.  We have to know how much they are likely to worry.  We have to  know what will reassure them.  We have to <em>know</em> our kids.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Can I ask you to do two things?</p>
<ol>
<li>Please pray for those directly affected by this disaster.  If you are on <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum">twitter </a>you might like to use the hashtag #pray4qld as well as #TCYasi</li>
<li>Turn the TV off. Don&#8217;t leave it running, replaying the disaster over and over again in front of your kids.  Watch some together. Answer their questions. Talk about what we can all do to help. Then turn the TV off.</li>
</ol>
<h2><em>If you would like me, and other readers, to pray for anyone in particular in Yasi&#8217;s path, please just leave a comment below. We will hold them in prayer throughout the night and into tomorrow. Blessings, Cath. xx</em></h2>
