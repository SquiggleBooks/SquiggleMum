				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On the weekend we had the opportunity to visit the <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/">Illawarra Fly treetop walk</a>, and participate in their September <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/specials/ifly-4-kids/">kids holiday program</a>: <strong>Bugs @ the Fly</strong>.<span id="more-6481"></span></p>
<p>We did the bug session first, following our guide from Wildlife Sydney Zoo to a couple of tents tucked into the bushland. As well as hearing all about insects and arachnids, the kids got to interact with a range of invertebrates. They enjoyed holding the giant millipede, investigating meal worms and hunting for stick insects.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/meal-worms.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6484 aligncenter" alt="meal worms" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/meal-worms-695x1024.jpg" width="483" height="711" /></a></p>
<p>After the session we headed to the treetop walk itself. It&#8217;s quite a structure, and one of the most substantial suspended walkways we have visited. Knight&#8217;s Tower provides an amazing view over the Illawarra escarpment and right out to the ocean. Despite being constructed entirely of steel, be warned that the springboard cantilever sections do sway slightly (which unnerved my 7yr old)! The Fly really does give kids a chance to check out life in the tree tops, and see the rainforest from a new perspective.<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/treetop-boy2.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-6485 aligncenter" alt="treetop boy2" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/treetop-boy2-682x1024.jpeg" width="483" height="725" /></a></p>
<p>Things to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Birds &#8211; some colourful species we saw included <a href="http://birdsinbackyards.net/species/Acanthorhynchus-tenuirostris">Eastern Spinebills</a>, <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Malurus-lamberti">Variegated Fairy-wrens</a>, and <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Eopsaltria-australis">Eastern Yellow Robins</a>. We even glimpsed a <a href="http://www.birdsinbackyards.net/species/Menura-novaehollandiae">Superb Lyrebird</a> on the way home!</li>
<li>Tree hollows &#8211; how many can you count from the tree top walk? What might live there?</li>
<li>Wombat home &#8211; can you find the wombat crossing? Wombat hollow? Wombat letterbox?!</li>
<li>Steps &#8211; how many steps can you count on the way up to Knight&#8217;s Tower?</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/knights-tower.jpeg"><img class="wp-image-6488 aligncenter" alt="knights tower" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/knights-tower-682x1024.jpeg" width="483" height="725" /></a></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/">Illawarra Fly</a> has great facilities for families, including cafe with indoor and outdoor seating, picnic tables, and clean toilets. Book online for best value tickets. The kids holiday program, <a href="http://www.illawarrafly.com/specials/ifly-4-kids/">iFly 4 Kids</a> (which includes entry to The Fly) does sell out quickly, so book early for the Christmas holidays!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The amazing life cycle of a cicada. We watched this cicada nymph emerge as an adult in our own backyard. Fascinating. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: MUM! You have to see this. It&#8217;s weird. And cool. <em>M-U-M</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5934" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think that&#8217;s a cicada nymph.  Can you see the shell underneath? We sometimes find empty cicada shells, don&#8217;t we? It looks like this little guy didn&#8217;t quite make it out.  <span id="more-5933"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5935" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>A few minutes later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Mum, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s dead after all. He&#8217;s moving!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5936" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: You&#8217;re right! He&#8217;s pulling himself up to the tree now, and I think those wings are getting bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5937" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Now his whole body has come out of the shell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Wow, look how his abdomen curls out like that. It really IS weird and cool. You were right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I know.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5938" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Whoa! Check out his wings!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Are they growing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: No, I think they are just getting bigger as they are drying out. See how they are wrinkly and curled up? I think they need to be all smooth before he can fly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">Butterflies</a> have to wait for their wings to dry before they can fly too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Good thinking. I wonder if all flying insects have to wait for their wings to dry&#8230;?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5939" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Do you think his wings are ready now Mum?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I don&#8217;t know. I guess we&#8217;ll have to keep watching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5940" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: He&#8217;s crawling away from his shell now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Maybe he&#8217;s not quite ready for flying yet&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mr 3: I can get him and &#8220;fly&#8221; him for you if you like</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5 and Me: <strong>NO!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5943" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="398" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>An hour later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Dinner time kids. Time to come inside now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: But I want to see him fly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5942" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Let&#8217;s take one last photo before the sun sets. Can you see how his wings are much closer to his body now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Before they were out flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think he will stay there now until it&#8217;s dark, and fly away in the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5941" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I&#8217;ll check if he&#8217;s gone in the morning&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you have a child who is into bugs, you might like to watch the following 5min documentary snippet from Sir David Attenborough about the life cycle of cicadas in America.  (Stop it at the 4min mark if you aren&#8217;t ready to explain what the male and female adult insects are doing together&#8230;)  In Australia, our cicadas don&#8217;t emerge on mass the same way &#8211; but they are still pretty noisy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My kids are energetic.  Very energetic.  I think most happy, healthy kids are &#8211; but it&#8217;s good to slow them down sometimes and help them to notice life&#8217;s little things.  One way we like to do this outside is to go on a bug hunt.  There are interesting insects and other small creatures all around, but often we don&#8217;t notice them because we are too busy.  Open your child&#8217;s eyes to the wonder of bugs!<span id="more-5707"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/red-bugs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5709" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/red-bugs.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="630" /></a></p>
<p>Although you can go on a bug hunt with nothing but a pair of eyes, kids often respond more enthusiastically when they have a few &#8220;tools&#8221; to use.  You might even like to make up a bug-kit for your child, with some of the following items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Magnifying glass &#8211; for looking up close. Even young kids enjoy the magic of magnification.</li>
<li>Camera or smart phone &#8211; our tech savvy kids are quite used to having Mum&#8217;s phone on hand to take photos of interesting things!  This is a good way to let them have a go at taking photos independently.</li>
<li>Notebook and pencil &#8211; older children may like to make a list (words or pictures) of the insects they find.</li>
<li>Tweezers &#8211; not for bugs!! These can be useful for gently lifting up leaves and bark from the ground to reveal creatures hidden underneath.  Great activity for developing fine motor skills too.</li>
<li>Bug catcher &#8211; Depending on what your kids find, they may want to put an insect into a bug catcher to observe more closely. Unless we are sure an insect is safe to touch, we put critters into the bug catcher by picking up the leaf or stick they are on, rather than picking up the bug.  I encourage my kids to release any creatures they have caught at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities like this also provide an opportunity for conversations about nature. Try asking some of these questions when your child discovers an interesting critter.  Remember that open ended questions require your child to think at a higher level, and create much richer discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Questions</strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stink_bugs.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5711 alignright" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stink_bugs.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="384" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>What colour is it?</li>
<li>How many legs does it have?</li>
<li>Where did you find it?</li>
<li>Is it bigger or smaller than your fingernail?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open Ended Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is it similar to any other bugs you have seen? In what way?</li>
<li>If you were a scientist in charge of naming this creature, what would you call it?</li>
<li>What do you think it eats? Why?</li>
<li>What do you think might eat IT?</li>
<li>Do you think the babies and adults of this bug look the same as each other, or different. Why do you think that?</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Happy hunting!</strong></em></p>
