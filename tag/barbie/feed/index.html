				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Be gentle with me on this one, ok?</strong></p>
<p>So you remember the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/the-barbie-debate/">Barbie post</a>?  (If not you might want to jump back and read it <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/the-barbie-debate/">here</a>.)  In the post I shared my thoughts about Barbie, and my personal reasons for not purchasing the dolls for my daughter.  The post sparked LOTS of healthy debate.  Some mums agreed with my concerns regarding body image, some shared that while they played with Barbies themselves as kids they don&#8217;t want them for their daughters, while others publicly declared their love for the dolls of their childhood.</p>
<p>We are a Barbie-free house.  Backtrack. We <em><strong>were</strong></em> a Barbie-free house.  Somehow, despite hearing nothing about Barbies at home, my daughter has still caught the Barbie bug.  First of all we had this&#8230; &#8220;<em>Mummy, if I could only have ONE thing for Christmas, I would wish for a Barbie.</em>&#8221;  My eyes widened while my husband stifled a chuckle.</p>
<p>And then there was this note from Kindy:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>For the Christmas Concert, your child has chosen to dress up as: Princess Barbie. Please provide a suitable costume.</h2>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some times as a mother when I believe you should stand your ground.  There are also times when I think you should back down graciously.</p>
<p>My opinion of Barbie hasn&#8217;t changed. If I&#8217;m perfectly honest she still makes me feel a little inadequate. But for the sake of my daughter, I need to take a deep breath and be a big girl.  My issues are mine alone.  She will have enough of her own without taking mine on board as well.  <strong>So, I am graciously backing down from this one</strong>.</p>
<p>I bought her a Barbie t-shirt to wear in the kindy play.   (Yes, I did cringe handing it over at the checkout.)  She will dress it up with her own accessories and a home made crown.   And I&#8217;m <em><strong>considering </strong></em>her one Christmas wish.</p>
