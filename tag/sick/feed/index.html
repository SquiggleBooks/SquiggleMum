<p>I have both kids home sick today.  One is quite cheery, despite being very unwell. The other is quite miserable, despite not being all that sick!  Typical.</p>
<p>Here are 10 things to do with kids on sick days. (Thanks to my <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum">facebook </a>readers for some of these suggestions).  A word of caution though &#8211; if you make the day too much fun they won&#8217;t want to go to school tomorrow!!</p>
<p><span id="more-4845"></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Make them <strong>rest</strong>. If they are sick enough to be home, rest is mandatory. In our house that means being on your bed for an hour after lunch (not in front of the tv&#8230;)</li>
<li>Get <strong>outside</strong>. Fresh air can work wonders. Just make sure you choose a sensible time of day, and dress your child appropriately for the weather.  (40 degree days aren&#8217;t ideal, nor is snow!)</li>
<li>Watch a <strong>movie</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Box construction</strong>.  Kids of all ages enjoy making things with boxes. Pull boxes out of the recyling bin, hunt for some toilet rolls, dig a few shoeboxes out of the cupboard and let them go for it.</li>
<li>Make <strong>jelly</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Read </strong>stories.  You know that story on the shelf that your child asks for at bedtime, and you look at your watch and say, &#8220;<em>Maybe another night. Pick again</em>&#8220;&#8230;?! Yep, this is the day for those stories.</li>
<li>Tackle a <strong>tidying </strong>job together.  Sort out that messy plastics draw, or the linen cupboard.</li>
<li><strong>Colour </strong>in.  I&#8217;m not usually a fan of mindless colouring, but it can be an excellent sick day activity. Lots of free printable pages are available online. Find something that is of interest to your child.</li>
<li><strong>Playdough</strong>. Make it from scratch (it only takes a few minutes), and let your child choose the colour. Older kids love adding straws, googly eyes, bamboo skewers, feathers etc to the playdough.</li>
<li><strong>Write </strong>a letter, postcard or email to someone. It&#8217;s a good way of sneaking some writing into the day <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, if <em><strong>you </strong></em>are also sick, you should only attempt 1, 3 and 8.  And possibly 5.  Of course there&#8217;s always option 11. which is call for backup&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any other suggestions to add? If so please leave a comment and we might try it this afternoon!</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have had a week of sickness, with both kids battling a raging fever followed by sniffles and the kind of cough that makes other mums raise their eyebrows.  The thermometer is in constant use, and the infant paracetamol is getting a workout too.  I think we&#8217;re through the worst of it now, with only the cough hanging on, but I&#8217;ll have to keep an eye on the little man as he is prone to <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/just-what-the-doctor-ordered/">ear infections</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sick_child.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4163" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/sick_child.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>This morning <a href="http://96five.com">on air</a> I shared some thoughts about dealing with sick kids.  Here are my three top tips:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lower your expectations</strong> &#8211; Obviously the kids aren&#8217;t going to be at their best. Relax the routine, let go of the little things, be realistic about meal times, and don&#8217;t stress about the house (no one will be visiting anyway)!</li>
<li><strong>Cancel your plans</strong> &#8211; If you have little ones under school age, cancel anything you can! Don&#8217;t bother with trying to squeeze things in&#8230; just let people know that the kids are unwell and you&#8217;ll reschedule asap.  If you have school aged kids, cancel school for a day or two (and sadly, yes, whatever you had planned too), and cancel afterschool activities until they are 100% well again.</li>
<li><strong>Take shifts at night</strong> &#8211; Find a system that works for your family, so that you aren&#8217;t working 24-7. We either take turns night and night about so that only one of us is getting up, or take pre-midnight shifts and post-midnight shifts.  (This week though, our little boy only wants Daddy during the night!!)  Single mamas, you need extra help during the day because you have to deal with v-e-r-y long night shifts.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Working mums, how do you juggle your career with caring for sick little ones?  Do most of your sick leave days get used when the kids are sick, or when you are? Any tips to share?<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>SAHMs, how do you give yourself time to recharge so that you don&#8217;t go insane?!  Do you have a top tip to share?<br />
</strong></p>
