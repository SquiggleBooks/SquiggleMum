				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BenSanders_IveAnUncleIvan.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6282" alt="" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/BenSanders_IveAnUncleIvan-1024x640.jpg" width="590" height="369" /></a></p>
<p>If you are in Melbourne this weekend, there&#8217;s a <a href="http://lamingtondrive.com/exhibitions/event/i-ve-an-uncle-ivan/">book launch</a> not to be missed. Friend and colleague, <a href="http://bensillustrations.blogspot.com.au/">Ben Sanders</a>, is launching his first picture book! Ben is a <a href="http://themilkagency.com.au/">graphic designer</a> and illustrator of serious repute. His work regularly appears in mags, newspapers, books and advertising. You&#8217;ve probably seen his cool design work without even knowing. But, after reading &#8220;I&#8217;ve an Uncle Ivan&#8221; with your kids &#8211; you&#8217;re sure to recognise his work in the future.<span id="more-6280"></span></p>
<p><em>&#8220;I&#8217;ve an Uncle Ivan&#8221; is a free-wheeling rhyme illustrated in a nostalgic 1950s style that introduces readers to Uncle Ivan, his extended family and 14 different modes of transport. Ivan has a niece on skates, who has two hitchhiking brothers. They have a cousin on a scooter, whose sister drives a Mini&#8230; And so it goes until we meet the whole family, who are travelling to a secret destination on every form of transport from unicycles to bi-planes to trams! </em></p>
<p>And yes, Ben really does have an Uncle called Ivan.</p>
<p>I love the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/endpapers/">endpapers</a> in this cool, quirky book. There&#8217;s even a 3D model that kids can pop out, colour, and build so that they can retell the story and interact with the characters. Check it out!</p>
<p><iframe width="604" height="453" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/vCagxDv48dQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>The <a href="http://lamingtondrive.com/exhibitions/event/i-ve-an-uncle-ivan/">launch</a> this Saturday is bound to be a hoot. Expect lemonade and fairy bread, balloon artist, activities and more. If you get along to it, tell Ben (and his wife and kids) I said hi&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong>:</p>
<p>This is a sweet story which will appeal to young girls, and in my opinion the best of Michelle Worthington&#8217;s work to date. What will Ava wear on a windy, yellow-dress-kind-of-day, when her yellow dress is nowhere to be found? Sophie Norsa&#8217;s illustrations are an absolute delight. A small percentage of the royalties go towards supporting children with Rett Syndrome.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[I was so delighted to receive some recognition for one of my picture book manuscripts at the CYA Conference on the weekend.  I placed SECOND in the non-fiction picture book category! (With a story about birds... of course.)
]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Though I have been quieter this year online, I have still been writing as much as ever.  I first started this blog back in 2008 to work on my writing, and build an audience.  It has certainly done that &#8211; and more!  I really like writing for mums, and enjoy the interaction and conversation with others that blogging enables.  But, when it comes down to it, my first love will always be writing for kids.<span id="more-6113"></span></p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I was so delighted to receive some recognition for one of my picture book manuscripts at the <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/index.html">CYA Conference</a> on the weekend.  I placed SECOND in the non-fiction picture book category! (With a story about birds&#8230; of course.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CYA-12-collage-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6115" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/CYA-12-collage-pic.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="800" /></a></p>
<p>It was so exciting spending the day with other authors, aspiring writers, editors, publishers and industry professionals.  I especially enjoyed meeting author <a href="http://katswhiskers.wordpress.com/">Kathryn Apel</a>. Kat and I have been twitter-friends for a long time, so it was great to finally meet. I also got to catch up with fellow nature nerd Penny from <a href="http://www.wildlifefun4kids.com/">Wildlife Fun 4 Kids</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully from here I will be able to find an interested publisher, and it won&#8217;t be too long before you can get your hands on a copy of one of my picture books&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When meeting author/illustrator <a href="http://www.narelleoliver.com">Narelle Oliver</a> at the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/2012-national-year-of-reading-read-up-launch/">Read Up launch</a> recently, I <em><strong>might</strong></em> have mentioned that Miss 5 and I are kind of into birds&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;which of course lead us into a discussion about Narelle&#8217;s award winning picture book, <strong><em>Fox and Fine Feathers, </em></strong>with her signature linocut illustrations.<span id="more-5982"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5983" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Lyrebird, Coucal, Pitta and Nightjar are birds of the forest floor. Although as different as groundbirds can be, they always look out for danger and warn each other to hide. One day, Lyrebird, Coucal and Pitta forget to look out for Fox. Only Nightjar is watching. Can he warn the others in time?</em></p>
<p>We loved learning more about these four beautiful Australian rainforest birds from the story:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superb Lyrebirds</strong> are incredibly shy creatures.  They are rarely seen, but often heard as they mimic the calls of other birds.  Males have long, intricate tail feathers.</li>
<li><strong>Pheasant Coucals</strong> are sizeable black and brown birds. They are not particularly adept at flying, so prefer to run after their prey.</li>
<li><strong>Noisy Pittas</strong> are brightly coloured little rainforest birds.  They hop about in the undergrowth, and although quite common are not often seen.</li>
<li><strong>Long-tailed Nightjars</strong> are masters of disguise.  Their feathers are perfectly camouflaged amongst the leaf litter during the day while they sleep.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5986" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="313" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: left"></div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to talking about birds, we also discussed the problems introduced species, such as foxes, can cause to fragile ecosystems.  Other introduced species to Australia include cane toads, rabbits, and (feral) cats.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This picture book is not only a wonderful read, but is rich with opportunities to discuss habitats, birdlife, camouflage, predators and more.  Great for low to mid primary, and any kids with an interest in wildlife.  (For my teacher friends, Scholastic provide <a href="http://www.scholastic.com.au/schools/education/teacherresources/assets/pdfs/Fox_and_Fine_Feathers.pdf">Teachers&#8217; Notes</a> on <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for classroom use.)</div>
<p><strong>Courtesy of Narelle Oliver herself, I have a SIGNED copy of <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for one lucky SquiggleMum reader.  To enter, simply leave a comment below and tell me an Australian bird that your kids have seen in your area.  </strong>(It&#8217;s a great excuse to  look out for birds this week&#8230;)  One entry per person, Aussie residents only, comp closes Sun 18/3/12 8pm Qld time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-pitta2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5987" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-pitta2-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; If you adore Narelle&#8217;s work, prints from the book are available at the gorgeous <a href="http://www.marksandgardner.com/">Marks and Gardner</a> gallery online, or at their beautiful premises on Mt Tamborine.  Tell them SquiggleMum sent you <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></em></p>
<p>*I received a copy of the book from Narelle Oliver, but did not receive payment for this post.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">_____________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>This competition has now closed. Congratulations Judith. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>You are the winner of a signed copy of Fox and Fine Feathers</strong>!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you love to read? Love encouraging your kids to read? 2012 will be full of exciting literary events because it is the National Year of Reading!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Love2Read-green-purple.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5918" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Love2Read-green-purple-1024x509.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="214" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Today the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MBRC.libraries">Moreton Bay Regional Libraries</a> launched the <em>Read Up</em> program for under 8s.  To encourage kids to visit their local library and borrow on their own card, the <em>Read Up</em> program rewards children with special certificates designed by some of Queensland&#8217;s best illustrators.<span id="more-5917"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Two of these amazing illustrators, <a href="http://petercarnavas.com/">Peter Carnavas</a> and <a href="http://narelleoliver.com">Narelle Oliver</a>, were both at the launch today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/peter-carnavas-squigglemum.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5920" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/peter-carnavas-squigglemum.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I have <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/book-of-the-month-the-great-expedition/">reviewed</a> <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/author-illustrator-peter-carnavas/">several</a> of Pete&#8217;s books before, and always rate them highly.  Peter spent time with the kids at the launch today teaching them how to draw an illustration.  He explained that if you can draw a circle, a line and a dot &#8211; you can draw anything!    It was wonderful to watch a bunch of kids drawing comical sharks together.  Even my 3yr old had a go!  Peter also talked with the kids about how an illustration has to involve more than simply a character.  An illustration must tell the story.  Check out the &#8220;story&#8221; below&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/peter-squiggle-kids.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5921" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/peter-squiggle-kids.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="420" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">It was such a delight to also meet award winning illustrator <a href="http://narelleoliver.com">Narelle Oliver</a>.  I have long been a fan of Narelle&#8217;s work as it often focuses on Australian animals in their natural habitats.  Her linocut prints are a distinctive trademark, and provide a wonderful opportunity to talk with kids about different ways artists create their illustrations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/narelle-oliver-squigglemum.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5924" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/narelle-oliver-squigglemum.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Miss 5 was so excited when Narelle pulled a stowaway Thingamajig out of her bag, as this creature currently features all over her classroom wall at school!  The Very Blue Thingamajig was relieved to find that yes, he IS on one of the <em>Read Up</em> certificates.  The five <em>Read Up</em> certificates are beautifully designed artworks in their own right, and definitely worth collecting.  In addition to Narelle and Peter, the other contributing artists are Kerry Argent, Gregory Rogers, and Clare McFadden.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/narelle-oliver-thingamajig.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5926" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/narelle-oliver-thingamajig.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="428" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Your local library really is a treasure trove of top quality Australian picture books.  These amazing certificates might be just the inspiration <del>you</del> your children need to head to the library this week. Happy reading!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/read-up-certificates.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5928" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/read-up-certificates-300x291.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="291" /></a></p>

<p><strong>To celebrate the launch of New Frontier&#8217;s Little Treasures Collection, I am delighted to have been able to interview Pete himself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>:  <em>Last Tree in the City</em> is my favourite of your published works. Do you have a favourite?</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong>:  It is always difficult to pick a favourite book as there are things I like about all of them (and some things I think I could have done better but I won’t mention those).  My sentimental favourite is <em>Sarah’s Heavy Heart</em> because it’s a different, dreamy sort of story.  It is the only story that really started with an image (of a girl carrying a big heart on her back) rather than the text or idea.  I’m quite happy with all of the illustrations and I am proud of the layers of meaning I put into that story.  Also, it’s dedicated to my wife so, really, it’s the most romantic of my tales.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong> &#8211; Which of your characters is most like you and why?</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong> &#8211; I’ve always thought the tortoise in <em>Sarah’s Heavy Heart</em> was a bit of a self-portrait.  I identify a lot with Sarah and the tortoise because I feel like I do things quite slowly and quietly and sometimes envy the spontaneity of others.  Without really meaning to, I’ve created most of my characters so they are a bit like me – quiet, generally keep to themselves, big noses.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong> &#8211; So as an author/illustrator, which comes first for you &#8211; the words or the pictures?</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong> &#8211; I think of an idea for a story first then pictures start popping into my head, though I don’t tend to draw anything until I’ve written the text.  As I write, I have the images in mind the whole time so it’s difficult to work out what comes first.  My goal is to make both elements interdependent in the finished story so it’s the same for the process.  The words and pictures bounce off each other the whole time, whether it’s in my head or on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong> &#8211; And how long does the process of developing a picture book take?</p>
<p><strong>Pete</strong> &#8211; It generally takes somewhere between three and six months, inbetween doing everything else in my life.  I spend a few months drawing roughs, then a few months painting the final illustrations.  Once all of my work is done, the design, printing and distribution will take another six months so it can be around a year from the moment I start on a book to the moment I’m reading it to children at schools.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong> &#8211; Finally Pete, what are your &#8220;tools of the trade&#8221; as an author/illustrator?</p>
<p>As an author, I like a pencil and notepad.  My stories are quite lean on words so it’s not too demanding for me to write them out with a pencil.  When I’ve finished the text, I’ll type it out and it’s done.  As an illustrator, I draft everything using an A2 sketchpad and have recently enjoyed drawing with very light pencils, H or 2H.  When it comes time to paint, I have traditionally used Arches medium watercolour paper, though I’m currently having a go using Saunders – thick enough, with a little less grain, making it easier for my ink outlines.  I only use about three or four brushes, with tubes of watercolour paint.  To finish off, I ink the outines with a few different nibs dipped into a jar of ink (the jar used to hold poppy seeds).</p>

<p><strong>Thanks so much Peter.  I look forward to your next picture book <em>Mr Darcy</em> being released shortly too!  Oh, and if you are thinking of creating a curly-haired, big nosed character any time soon&#8230; let me know <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></strong></p>
