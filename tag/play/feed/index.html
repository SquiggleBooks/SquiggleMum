				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again blogging has taken a back seat to real life, as we farewell our hometown of Brisbane. Relocating a family is a huge undertaking! We have spent the last few weeks in a whirlwind of cleaning, clearing, decluttering, and <a href="http://gumtree.com.au">gumtree</a>-ing in order to sell our home. At the same time, we&#8217;ve also been flying down to Sydney to find a suburb that will work for our family, and then lining up new home and school. Oh, and in between, catching up &#8220;just one more time&#8221; with all of our beautiful friends here in Brisbane.<span id="more-6297"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to our home. We moved here as new parents with a baby girl, and the house needed a LOT of work. Over the past seven years we have slowly but surely renovated it to suit our style and our growing family. Look at it now!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6298" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The backyard has also seen more than a few changes, and so many of them have featured here on the blog.</p>
<ul>
<li>We  created our own <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">dry creek bed</a>.</li>
<li>We built a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/backyard-letterbox/">post box</a>.</li>
<li>We installed huge <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/outdoor-chalk-boards/">chalk boards</a>.</li>
<li>We added <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">toy storage</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">climbed trees</a>. And <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">fell out of them</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/our-rope-ladder/">rope ladder</a>.</li>
<li>We created a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/garden-in-a-week/">veggie garden</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kids have really grown up in this back yard! Together we have explored</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">frogs</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">butterflies</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/watching-nature-unfold-cicada/">cicadas</a>, and other <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bug-hunt/">insects</a></li>
<li>Plant life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/seedpods/">seedpods</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/fantastic-fungus/">fungi</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/scientific-literacy/">more fungi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am so glad I have these posts as a record of our outdoor adventures in their pre-school years. Now at 7 and 4, the kids are getting older and their needs in our new backyard will be different &#8211; but I know these early experiences will impact on the way they play. They know how to <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/sticks-and-stones/">make their own fun</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/the-big-branch/">solve problems together</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bamboo-panflutes/">be creative</a> outdoors.</p>
<p>I am sad to say goodbye to this home, but grateful for all the learning and growing that has happened here. And I am ready for what is next&#8230;</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have bamboo in our backyard that goes wild after good rain. Out of nowhere the spears shoot up, rising way past the top of our 6ft fence, before sprouting leaves. It provides great screening, but often needs serious pruning! The kids have used the  pruned <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/outdoor-multi-age-play/">bamboo spears in their play </a>in the past. Recently we tried something new.<span id="more-6265"></span></p>
<p>Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>To make our panflute we first stripped the bamboo of leaves and cut sections of bamboo, which the kids ordered according to length. We wrapped string around the first section, joining it to the second, then the third, and so on. This was a bit fiddly. We then wrapped string around all of the five sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, we wrapped in between each section. This helped to pull it all together tightly. We trimmed all of the ends and left them hanging at one side. Traditionally these were often plaited decoratively, or used to create a neck strap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As you can see from the photos, our panflute is fairly rudimentary! We could have sanded the cut sections of bamboo, we could have sealed the ends with wax, we could have used a crossbar&#8230; If you want to try a more authentic method, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-4-easy-Bamboo-Flutes-for-free/step4/Bamboo-Flute-Panflute/">instructables</a> have a 50+ step DIY guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>For us, the fun of this activity was in making something from nothing. We created a real musical instrument with string, secateurs, and a plant from the backyard. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6269" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">What could you and your kids create in the backyard together&#8230;?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about free play: it requires very, very little. <strong>Children who are good at free play know how to make their own fun.</strong> They don&#8217;t need an adult to provide them with toys. They don&#8217;t need an adult to outline the rules. They don&#8217;t need an adult to explain the process. They don&#8217;t need an adult at all really! Free play can happen any time, any where, with whatever is around.<span id="more-6191"></span></p>
<p>My favourite memory from our recent trip to Far North Queensland was an afternoon spent on the beach at Cape Tribulation. Cape Trib is across the Daintree River by barge, as far north as you can drive in a regular vehicle. It&#8217;s literally the end of the road, though it feels more like the edge of the world. So beautiful.</p>
<p>With no toys and no plans, the kids enjoyed an afternoon of free play with only the things they found on the beach. Here&#8217;s what they did:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6194" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Collect.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Investigate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-imagine.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6196" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-imagine.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="599" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have previously shared some thoughts about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">children and risk</a>, both here on the blog and <a href="http://96five.com">on air</a>. And when my daughter knocked herself out by <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">falling while tree climbing</a> &#8211; my opinion was challenged, but ultimately unchanged.</p>
<p>While I am happy to share my perspective as an educator and a mother, I am not a child psychologist myself, so I was delighted to be able to interview <a href="http://www.pathwayshrc.com.au/about-us/professor-paula-barrett/">Dr Paula Barrett</a> about this topic.  Here are her thoughts on the risky business of childhood.<span id="more-6139"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6142" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Yes, my kids are playing with sticks&#8230;!)</p>
<p><strong>Paula, why is it important for children to be allowed to take risks in their play?</strong></p>
<p>There are several reasons but mainly because children learn and gain resilience through challenging experiences. If a child only ever does things within their comfort zone, where they completely understand all the potential outcomes, they don’t learn how to deal with not always achieving the right result or potential disappointment, which is extremely important in later life. Children learn the most when they are challenged.</p>
<p><strong>As parents, how do we know what is reasonable risk, and what is dangerous? </strong></p>
<p>Risk needs to be determined dependant on the particular child and what is developmentally appropriate. For example, a very young child may be able to climb a tree but doesn’t actually yet have the muscle strength for a successful climb – which can result in a dangerous situation. It is very useful to listen to your support networks to help guide you on this, such as grandparents who have great experience and parents with kids of a similar age as they may have dealt with similar situations.  There are also other networks you can rely on who have studied in this area, for example, child care workers, sport coaches etc – they can often make a valuable contribution to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Have today&#8217;s parents become too risk averse?  Why do you think this has happened?</strong></p>
<p>There are so many reasons for this but I think the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents are more isolated when bringing up children than they used to be. Involving your support networks can help you better evaluate risk by including those with experience, like grandparents or parents with kids of similar ages.</li>
<li>There are just so many rules – which are good in that they protect society at large however they can also inhibit children to take risk.</li>
<li>Kids time today is increasingly over-structured with too many scheduled activities &#8211; which minimises the opportunities children to be challenged outside of being told what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should we do to encourage children who are not natural risk takers?</strong></p>
<p>A great way to encourage children who are not natural risk takers is to help them form friendships with children who are.</p>
<p>And, as parents you can reassure them through modelling the behaviour– go outside with them and get involved.  You can try a step plan where you encourage them to face challenging situations in small steps – maybe once a week or once a fortnight, only moving them to the next step when they are ready.  It helps to reward them but not with things that you buy – it is more powerful to dedicate time to something that they love doing e.g. take them to the beach or build a cubby house with them.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any evidence to suggest that encouraging kids to take risks in play might lead to risky behaviour later in life? </strong></p>
<p>No, there is none at all! Children taking risks during play build self-confidence, whereas developing good judgement or self-regulation is another issue all together. Risk taking in adulthood is more about personality and life choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> _______________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Many thanks to Dr Paula Barrett for answering my questions about kids and risk, and the team from MILO for arranging the interview. I am proud to be a MILO Play Ambassador!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[5 outdoor activities using tin cans, plus win a MILO Play Kit]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very pleased to be an ambassador for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/miloausnz">MILO Play Movement</a> in 2012.  Play is a child&#8217;s work, and the importance of play in children&#8217;s development cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>MILO sent the SquiggleKids a fantastic play kit (final photo) to use in the backyard &#8211; and <strong>I&#8217;ve got one play kit to give away to a lucky SquiggleMum reader as well</strong>!  The kit contains soccer nets, cones, a selection of different balls and even a ball pump for your kids to use outside, plus a couple of tins of MILO.<span id="more-6036"></span></p>
<p>So of course, you know what my kids have had the most fun with, don&#8217;t you&#8230;?  <strong>The tins!!  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6041" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Kids have been inventing games with MILO tins for as long as MILO has been around. The labels might have changed, but not much else has. Here are 5 activities that are sure to bring back memories, and your own kids might like them too:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1.  Tin can stilts</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">2. Tin can telephone</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you don&#8217;t live in Brisbane&#8217;s northern suburbs, and in case you missed the pics on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum" target="_blank">facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum" target="_blank">twitter</a>&#8230; yes, my kids were on the front page of the local paper.  I might be slightly biased but I think it&#8217;s a great photo.  Not just because they&#8217;re both smiling and looking at the camera, but because they are swinging from a rope ladder in our backyard.</p>
<p><span id="more-5844"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-frnt-page.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5845" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-frnt-page.png" alt="" width="600" height="478" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I love the headline too: <em>Swing back to good old fun</em>.  Couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself!  Even after receiving lots of lovely new things for Christmas, my kids are still happiest when they are monkeying around freely in the backyard.  This $12 rope ladder has provided hours of priceless fun and is still going strong after a year outside!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The front page pic is accompanied by a story and photo on page 5 about playscapes.  In the article, Rebekah Hurworth from <a href="http://yourarchitect.com.au/" target="_blank">Your Architect</a> says, &#8220;<em>&#8230; by incorporating sandpits, rockpools, cubby houses, reading areas and outdoor kitchen areas, children can spend hours entertaining themselves outside.</em>&#8221;  If you are interested in natural playscapes, you might also like to read this great pdf <a href="http://www.kidsafensw.org/docs/factsheets/PAU/Natural%20Playspaces%20KL%202011.pdf">fact sheet from Kidsafe</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-pg5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5846" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-pg5.png" alt="" width="501" height="457" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">You can see our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/backyard-sand-play/">sandpit</a>, the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">dry creek bed</a> and one of the bridges in the background, plus a bucket hanging from a pulley under the trees.  Our playscape is ever changing and growing, and always has something to offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>What do your kids do in the backyard?  And what did YOU do outside as a kid??</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PS &#8211; Yes, my kids usually have hats on outside <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PPS &#8211; Yes, the architect is also my little sister <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you grow up with sprinklers in the back yard?  I have fond memories of spending hot summer days running and jumping through the spray with my sister.  I remember those long green tube-like sprinklers, and the groovy ones that could spin around. I even remember being allowed to run through the sprinklers on the school oval when temperatures reached over 35 deg C.  And then of course there was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip_'n_Slide">slip&#8217;n&#8217;slide</a>&#8230;<span id="more-5694"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/slip-slide.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5695" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/slip-slide.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="473" /></a></p>
<p>My kids don&#8217;t even know what a sprinkler is.  Water restrictions have been in place for years here in Queensland, and despite the odd <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/brisbane-floods-processing-through-play/">flood</a> or <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/family/cyclone-yasi-and-media-storms/">cyclone</a> &#8211; the grass is still so brown and dry around Brisbane that it crackles under the kids&#8217; feet.  <strong>So can you imagine how excited we are that water restrictions have been eased for a week?!</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal">If it&#8217;s been a while since your kids enjoyed water play, try some of these ideas:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Run through the sprinkler.  Make sure you move the sprinkler around the yard every so often so that the garden gets a good watering too.  And for those also in SE Qld, don&#8217;t forget that sprinklers do use a lot of water, and we still have to pay for the extra water we use this week.</li>
<li>Washing up.  This is one of those tasks that mums detest and kids love.  Take a big bowl outside filled with water and a little dishwashing detergent.  Let the kids wash duplo blocks, playdough cutters, dolls, plastic cars, whatever you like. Just sit everything on a towel in the sun to dry.</li>
<li>Water fights.  Depending on the age of your kids, you might like to try soaking each other with spray bottles, water pistols, water balloons or even just the hose.  Kids love it when parents get involved too.</li>
<li>Water walls.  I have seen several <a href="http://progressiveearlychildhoodeducation.blogspot.com/2011/02/planning-new-water-wall-for-water-play.html">posts</a> (via Let The Children Play) and <a href="http://pinterest.com/squigglemum/playscapes/">pinterest</a> pics lately featuring water walls.  I think my kids would really enjoy the challenge of designing their own wall somewhere outside.</li>
<li>Free creative play.  Often the best fun is the fun you make yourself.  Simply put out an assortment of objects and a large container of water, or hose with a trigger nozzle, and see what your kids come up with!  They are bound to entertain themselves.</li>
<li>Bring back the slip&#8217;n&#8217;slide!  (Just remember that little bodies cope with slippin&#8217; and slidin&#8217; far better than grownup bodies.  A trip down memory lane could result in a trip to the hospital.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What other water activities do your kids enjoy?  Share in the comments below so that we can all try them! </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/slip-slide-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5701" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/slip-slide-2.jpg" alt="" width="630" height="473" /></a><br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>An outdoor chalkboard is another project I have had on my to-do list for a while. I love the idea of children having lots of writing and drawing opportunities outdoors.  I often find that writing naturally flows outside without the pressure of a classroom environment or the constraints of A4 paper.  Chalk is inviting too, because of its non-permanent nature and its accessibility for little hands. (<em>In fact, Mr 2 drew his first &#8220;people&#8221; pictures on the chalk board! See bottom left picture.</em>)<span id="more-5569"></span></p>
<p>Since adding <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">basket storage to our fences</a>, I have seen the potential in using fences to enhance the playspace rather than merely marking the garden&#8217;s boundaries.  So, we attached the large blackboard directly to the fence!  I also made a couple of extra smaller blackboards which can be moved around and used as needed.  One is a menu board in the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>, the other is waiting for playful inspiration&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboards.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5570" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboards.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="454" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Purchasing large chalk boards can be expensive. Making them yourself isn&#8217;t!  We bought marine ply for our boards so that they would withstand the outdoor conditions.  The cost was less than $15.  We then gave the plywood two coats of chalkboard paint.  The paint was under $20 and we still have a LOT left over for future projects.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Oh, and an old teacher-tip for you: <strong>to make chalk drawings semi-permanent, soak the chalk in a strong solution of sugar and water before using</strong>.  I drew the leaves in a corner of the large board, and the word <em>Menu </em>on one of the smaller boards in sugar-soaked chalk.  The kids can rub over them, and they won&#8217;t rub off!  This trick lasts a long time inside, but a good soaking rain will still wash it away outside.  (We used to do this to draw the blue-and-white handwriting lines on the classroom blackboards to save ruling them up every day).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboard-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5572" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/outdoor-blackboard-sq.jpg" alt="outdoor play blackboard chalk board " width="420" height="420" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">What do you think? Anyone else want to try this easy project?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Every now and then I have great idea, followed closely by </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>&#8220;<em>Why didn&#8217;t I think of this sooner?</em>&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fence-storage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5491" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fence-storage.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The simple ideas are always the best. I simply screwed a couple of old brass hooks (which were lying unused in the bottom of a toolbox) onto the fence at child height.  We were already using the two green baskets for outdoor toy storage.  I love them because:<span id="more-5490"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>dirt and sand fall out through the gaps</li>
<li>rain water doesn&#8217;t collect in the bottom</li>
<li>there are no dark corners so it&#8217;s less likely a redback will move in</li>
<li>the kids can see into them</li>
<li>they are lightweight and easy to move around</li>
<li>they were only $2 each</li>
</ul>
<p>Hanging them on the fence was a stroke of genius (if I do say so myself).  I also added a couple of S hooks to the vine on the fence for the kids&#8217; stilts.  These weren&#8217;t getting much use in the bottom of a box, but are much more inviting hanging up like this.  Wonder what else I can attach to the fence&#8230;?!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spotted these popstick-girl-shapes in a craft store, and grabbed a packet immediately.  I just knew they would come in handy for&#8230; well, for something!  When Miss 5 was recently at home sick they provided wonderful entertainment.</p>
<p>I put out any sparkly collage materials I could find, as well as some fabric and PVA glue.  I also had a few leftover precut felt butterfly shapes which proved perfect for wings.  My daughter didn&#8217;t need any help (or any encouragement to get started)!  She busied herself for most of the day creating different families of fairies.  Water fairies, tree fairies, dirt fairies, vine fairies.  It was one big sparkly creative mess!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fairy_making.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5458" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fairy_making.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The next day we were able to take the fairies outside into the garden.  The paddlepop sticks pushed easily into the ground, and also proved useful as handles for when the fairies wanted to flutter about.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">It was wonderful to hear Miss 5 make up her own stories using the fairy families.  We were able to talk about what makes a good story, and the need for a &#8220;problem&#8221; to be resolved.  We even whipped out the iphone and recorded some of the stories.  They will be fun to look back on one day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fairy_garden.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5459" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fairy_garden.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I&#8217;m so glad I kept my hands out of the making process, and let my daughter do it her way.  No end product to copy.  No &#8220;do it like this&#8221; moments.  No adult interference.  And I think her fairies are rather beautiful.  Don&#8217;t you?</p>
