				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">This week I received a bittersweet letter from </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.compassion.com.au/index.php">Compassion Australia</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, letting us know that the child we have sponsored for many years no longer requires our financial support. She is now 15, and while we are so pleased her family in Indonesia is finally doing well financially, we are also sad as she has been an important part of our own family. Her photo has always been on the fridge alongside our own children&#8217;s school photos.<span id="more-6595"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.compassion.com.au/banner.php?intid=99&amp;strkey=97915ea0-66e6-11e3-b0a1-005056b06a0e" height="250" width="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>When we told the kids that we would be sponsoring a new child, we were surprised at their response. Both had instant and very strong feelings, and put forward their opinions without being asked. Mr 5 said, &#8220;Thailand. I think we should sponsor a child from Thailand Mummy. That is a poor country you know.&#8221; (How does he know anything about Thailand?!) Miss 7 said, &#8220;We really should choose a young child. If we sponsor a young child, we can have a big impact on their life Mum.&#8221; Wise words from someone still so young herself.</p>
<p><strong>So today I called Compassion. I found myself all choked up on the phone as I requested that we sponsor a young, needy child in Thailand. I don&#8217;t cry easily, and almost never in front of strangers, so it caught me a little off guard. </strong></p>
<p>I think my emotional reaction comes from the fact that God put the child we should sponsor onto the hearts of my own kids &#8211; and they were in tune with Him enough to listen. We sponsor because of the immeasurable impact it has on a child we will never meet, but the truth is that it has an impact on our children too.</p>
<p>We might not be rich by Sydney-standards, but we certainly are wealthy when compared to poverty stricken families. This Christmas, somewhere in Thailand is a three year old boy whose life will change, simply because we said yes to Compassion. And his mother probably has tears in her eyes too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><em>New state, new city, new suburb.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>New house, new yard, new neighbourhood.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>New school, new church, new shopping centre.<span id="more-6310"></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/garie-beach.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6315" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/garie-beach.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Garie Beach, <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Royal-National-Park">Royal National Park</a>, NSW)</p>
<p>New things are exciting, but also a little unsettling. And when almost everything in your world is new, life can be very unsettled. I&#8217;m discovering that both holding on to the old, and embracing the new, are important elements in establishing life in a new place. Here are some things I&#8217;ve been doing to help my kids with the transition:</p>
<p>1.  Holding on to the old:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beds</strong>. Same beds, same sheets, same pjs. There&#8217;s something incredibly normalising about sleeping in your own bed.</li>
<li><strong>Routine</strong>. The same morning <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/routine-charts-for-easy-starts/">routine</a> chart that was on the fridge in Brisbane, is still on the fridge in Sydney. It&#8217;s business as usual on school mornings&#8230; make bed, uniform on, breakfast, teeth brushing, hair done, unstack dishwasher, pack bag. The uniforms might be different, but nothing else has changed there.</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>. Holding on to special friendships is important. Miss 7 has put framed photographs of her friends in pride of place in her bedroom. She has also sent a few text messages on my phone, and started some letter writing.</li>
</ul>
<div>2.  Embracing the new:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outdoor play</strong>. Our new yard is very different from the backyard the kids knew and loved in <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/goodbye-brisbane/">Brisbane</a>. For the first time ever, we have a flat patch of grass &#8211; so we bought a trampoline! Some serious jumping is great for warming up chilly little bodies who are used to a warmer climate.</li>
<li><strong>Exploring</strong>. Sydney is a beautiful part of the world. The city is big and busy, but away from the traffic there are rivers, bays, beaches and bushland to explore. While our family has some space from weekend commitments and after school activities, we are happily exploring <a href="http://www.sutherlandshireaustralia.com.au/">Sutherland Shire</a> where we now call home. (Pic above is in nearby <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Royal-National-Park">Royal National Park</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>. &#8220;Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, the other gold.&#8221; Making new friends is important in feeling like you belong in a place. As I encourage the kids to introduce themselves to other children, I am also endeavouring to lead by example and be proactive about meeting other mums myself.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Moving interstate with a young family is a big deal. It&#8217;s early days yet, but so far so good&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again blogging has taken a back seat to real life, as we farewell our hometown of Brisbane. Relocating a family is a huge undertaking! We have spent the last few weeks in a whirlwind of cleaning, clearing, decluttering, and <a href="http://gumtree.com.au">gumtree</a>-ing in order to sell our home. At the same time, we&#8217;ve also been flying down to Sydney to find a suburb that will work for our family, and then lining up new home and school. Oh, and in between, catching up &#8220;just one more time&#8221; with all of our beautiful friends here in Brisbane.<span id="more-6297"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to our home. We moved here as new parents with a baby girl, and the house needed a LOT of work. Over the past seven years we have slowly but surely renovated it to suit our style and our growing family. Look at it now!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6298" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The backyard has also seen more than a few changes, and so many of them have featured here on the blog.</p>
<ul>
<li>We  created our own <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">dry creek bed</a>.</li>
<li>We built a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/backyard-letterbox/">post box</a>.</li>
<li>We installed huge <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/outdoor-chalk-boards/">chalk boards</a>.</li>
<li>We added <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">toy storage</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">climbed trees</a>. And <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">fell out of them</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/our-rope-ladder/">rope ladder</a>.</li>
<li>We created a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/garden-in-a-week/">veggie garden</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kids have really grown up in this back yard! Together we have explored</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">frogs</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">butterflies</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/watching-nature-unfold-cicada/">cicadas</a>, and other <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bug-hunt/">insects</a></li>
<li>Plant life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/seedpods/">seedpods</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/fantastic-fungus/">fungi</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/scientific-literacy/">more fungi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am so glad I have these posts as a record of our outdoor adventures in their pre-school years. Now at 7 and 4, the kids are getting older and their needs in our new backyard will be different &#8211; but I know these early experiences will impact on the way they play. They know how to <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/sticks-and-stones/">make their own fun</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/the-big-branch/">solve problems together</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bamboo-panflutes/">be creative</a> outdoors.</p>
<p>I am sad to say goodbye to this home, but grateful for all the learning and growing that has happened here. And I am ready for what is next&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong>:</p>
<p>Pete is a friend and colleague. He continues to go from strength to strength with New Frontier, producing stories full of warm and sensitive characters. In <em>The Children Who Loved Books</em>, he challenges the notion that &#8220;stuff&#8221; makes us happy. The two children in the story, Angus and Lucy, don&#8217;t have very much &#8211; but with books and each other they have pretty much everything they need.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower primary</li>
<li>Family reading, followed by discussion about wants vs needs</li>
<li>Community story telling, particularly in lower socio economic areas</li>
</ul>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last month has been challenging journey for our little family through some ups and downs.</p>
<p>One of us came down with the flu, just as the other recovered.</p>
<p>One of us flew away from Brisbane, just as the other returned.</p>
<p>One family said hello to us, just as we say goodbye to another.</p>
<p>One friend welcomed a new baby, while heartbreakingly another will bury hers this week.<span id="more-5686"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mountain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5687" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mountain.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">When the going gets tough, priorities are stripped back to the barest essentials.  Social media seems unimportant when friends nearby desperately need a meal.  Keeping up with my reader comes second to keeping up with the housework.  And when we need to spend time as a family, talking about the big things of life and processing our feelings &#8211; the blog and everything else can wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I value my readers highly, and I love sharing with you all, but the truth is that you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> me.  My children and my husband, and close friends do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I didn&#8217;t start this post with, &#8220;<em>Sorry I haven&#8217;t blogged for a while&#8230;&#8221;</em> and I never will.  I&#8217;m not sorry.  Prioritising my family is the right thing to do.  I cannot possibly blog, speak or write with integrity about parenting if I don&#8217;t practise what I preach!  So please bear with me during the times I am less active online.  It simply means I am doing double-time offline; nurturing, loving and caring for those who truly need me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">And I know you understand that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">xx</p>
