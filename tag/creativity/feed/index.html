				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I spotted these popstick-girl-shapes in a craft store, and grabbed a packet immediately.  I just knew they would come in handy for&#8230; well, for something!  When Miss 5 was recently at home sick they provided wonderful entertainment.</p>
<p>I put out any sparkly collage materials I could find, as well as some fabric and PVA glue.  I also had a few leftover precut felt butterfly shapes which proved perfect for wings.  My daughter didn&#8217;t need any help (or any encouragement to get started)!  She busied herself for most of the day creating different families of fairies.  Water fairies, tree fairies, dirt fairies, vine fairies.  It was one big sparkly creative mess!!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fairy_making.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5458" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fairy_making.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The next day we were able to take the fairies outside into the garden.  The paddlepop sticks pushed easily into the ground, and also proved useful as handles for when the fairies wanted to flutter about.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">It was wonderful to hear Miss 5 make up her own stories using the fairy families.  We were able to talk about what makes a good story, and the need for a &#8220;problem&#8221; to be resolved.  We even whipped out the iphone and recorded some of the stories.  They will be fun to look back on one day!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fairy_garden.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5459" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/fairy_garden.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="404" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I&#8217;m so glad I kept my hands out of the making process, and let my daughter do it her way.  No end product to copy.  No &#8220;do it like this&#8221; moments.  No adult interference.  And I think her fairies are rather beautiful.  Don&#8217;t you?</p>
