				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging as SquiggleMum in 2008, with an eight week old baby in my arms and a toddler under my feet. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but with two school aged kids and a busy life offline &#8211; I&#8217;m finally ready to let go of SquiggleMum. Well, the mum part anyway. <span id="more-6843"></span></p>
<p>I rarely write about parenting these days, and I feel that stories of my children&#8217;s adventures (or misadventures as the case may be) aren&#8217;t for me to share anymore. So I&#8217;m making a new home online, at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">squigglebooks.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglebooks.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6844" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/squigglebooks-logo1.png" alt="squigglebooks logo1" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">SquiggleBooks</a> you&#8217;ll find a mix of book reviews, posts about children&#8217;s literacy, thoughts about education, and tips for teachers. You&#8217;ll also be able to keep up with the latest news about my own writing career, and definitely be among the first to know <del>if</del> when I land that elusive picture book contract. It&#8217;s a pretty basic site for now, but I expect it will grow and change just as this blog has.</p>
<p>Before I go, I&#8217;d like to thank a bunch of people who have been part of the SquiggleMum journey. There have been thousands of comments on the blog over the years &#8211; <em>thank you</em> to each of you who took time to connect here. Some readers have become friends &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for staying in touch and encouraging me along the way. I have been privileged to write for a number of other parenting sites and share parenting advice on air &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for having me.  I have also won several awards and been invited to speak about blogging at conferences &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for the opportunity. Thank you to the bloggers who have been with me since the beginning &#8211; especially Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a>, as well as Kate from <a href="http://picklebums.com">Picklebums</a>, and Kelly from <a href="http://beafunmum.com/">Be A Fun Mum</a>. (There are too many others to name!)</p>
<p>I hope that many of you will join me in this next chapter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Blessings,</h2>
<h2>Cath / SquiggleMum.</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;right&#8221; way to teach young children to read has been up for debate this week, following NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli&#8217;s announcement that universities will be required to teach phonics to preservice teachers. (See this article via <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/education-minister-orders-universities-to-teach-phonics-or-face-losing-accreditation/story-fni0cx12-1227019125456?nk=05c34a3558a9475e26ca1faa2730345c">The Daily Telegraph</a> for the story).<span id="more-6786"></span></p>
<p>I did my B.Ed in the mid nineties &#8211; and must admit that I learnt very little about <em>phonics</em> in my degree. (<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Although out on prac, I encountered a range of phonics programs adopted by schools.) </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I did however learn a great deal about </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">whole language </em>in my undergrad subjects,<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> and about the constructivist approach to reading instruction which has greatly impacted my teaching. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/teaching-teachers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6796" alt="teaching teachers" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/teaching-teachers.jpg" width="558" height="431" /></a></p>
<p>In my opinion, there shouldn&#8217;t be a <em>phonics</em> vs <em>whole language</em> war, because it isn&#8217;t necessarily either / or. And the truth is, when it comes down to classroom teachers &#8211; there ISN&#8217;T a war. We are all saying the same thing: <strong>our students need both</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Phonics are important. The ability to make sounds from symbols enables the reader to attempt unfamiliar words. But an understanding of whole language is important too because reading is about more than just sounds &#8211; it&#8217;s about making meaning. If you read but don&#8217;t understand, what&#8217;s the point? </span></p>
<p>I threw this topic out to my colleagues and readers (without giving my opinion), and unsurprisingly their comments confirmed my suspicions. Good teachers know that phonics are important. They also know that not all words can be sounded out, and that meaning can lie beyond graphemes. Here are some of their thoughts:</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/readers-thoughts-phonics.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6791" alt="readers thoughts phonics" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/readers-thoughts-phonics.png" width="502" height="508" /></a></p>
<p><strong>So here is my summary:</strong></p>
<p><em>Dear Universities. Please incorporate phonics into undergrad teacher education, but don&#8217;t ditch the great stuff you are already doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Dear Teachers. Please keep being amazing, and continue adapting your methods to suit the needs of your learners. </em></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Dear Goverment. Please be careful what you mandate. Rarely, if ever, is a single methodology better than a multifaceted approach, and we could lose more than we gain.</span></em></p>
<p><em>Dear Parents. Please don&#8217;t get drawn into the media-fuelled, government fed  debate. Just keep reading aloud daily to your kids. It has more impact than you can possibly imagine. </em></p>
<p><strong>Any further thoughts you would like to add&#8230;?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I was so excited to receive a tin of these sweet story cards in the mail. If you haven&#8217;t come across them yet, let me introduce you to <a href="http://thatsmystory.com.au/">That&#8217;s My Story</a> cards.<span id="more-6571"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thats-my-story-set.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6574" alt="thats my story set" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/thats-my-story-set-1024x987.jpg" width="604" height="582" /></a></p>
<p>The tin is about the size of your phone and contains a set of glossy story telling cards. Each card has a simple isolated image on a white background.</p>
<ul>
<li>Red cards = character or object</li>
<li>Green cards = setting</li>
<li>Yellow cards = complication</li>
<li>Blue card = conclusion</li>
</ul>
<p>Every good story contains these elements, from picture books through to novels. Kids who recognise the basic elements of a story and understand narrative structure usually do much better in formal literacy lessons once they start school.</p>
<p>You can check out the suggested <a href="http://thatsmystory.com.au/pages/gameideas.php">game ideas</a> on the website, but I would keep it simple. <em>&#8220;Once upon a time there was a&#8230; (red card + green card). Suddenly&#8230; (yellow card). Oh no! But then&#8230;(happy ending).&#8221; </em></p>
<p>I think these open ended cards will get a good workout in our family: in the car, at coffee shops, at bedtime. They are also available as <a href="http://thatsmystory.com.au/catalog.php?category=1">foam stickers for bath time</a> story telling! They retail for $16.95 and would make excellent stocking stuffers, or Christmas gifts for little friends.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to Melissa from That&#8217;s My Story I have one set of cards to give away. To enter simply leave a comment below.</strong> Oh, and it&#8217;d be great if you pop over and like their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ThatsMYStoryCards">facebook</a> page too. (Entry is open to Australian residents only. One entry per person. Winner drawn at random Friday 6/12/13 8pm NSW time.)</p>

<p><strong>SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong>:</p>
<p>This is a sweet story which will appeal to young girls, and in my opinion the best of Michelle Worthington&#8217;s work to date. What will Ava wear on a windy, yellow-dress-kind-of-day, when her yellow dress is nowhere to be found? Sophie Norsa&#8217;s illustrations are an absolute delight. A small percentage of the royalties go towards supporting children with Rett Syndrome.</p>

<p><strong>SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong>:</p>
<p>Pete is a friend and colleague. He continues to go from strength to strength with New Frontier, producing stories full of warm and sensitive characters. In <em>The Children Who Loved Books</em>, he challenges the notion that &#8220;stuff&#8221; makes us happy. The two children in the story, Angus and Lucy, don&#8217;t have very much &#8211; but with books and each other they have pretty much everything they need.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower primary</li>
<li>Family reading, followed by discussion about wants vs needs</li>
<li>Community story telling, particularly in lower socio economic areas</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you love to read? Love encouraging your kids to read? 2012 will be full of exciting literary events because it is the National Year of Reading!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Love2Read-green-purple.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5918" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Love2Read-green-purple-1024x509.jpg" alt="" width="430" height="214" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Today the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/MBRC.libraries">Moreton Bay Regional Libraries</a> launched the <em>Read Up</em> program for under 8s.  To encourage kids to visit their local library and borrow on their own card, the <em>Read Up</em> program rewards children with special certificates designed by some of Queensland&#8217;s best illustrators.<span id="more-5917"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Two of these amazing illustrators, <a href="http://petercarnavas.com/">Peter Carnavas</a> and <a href="http://narelleoliver.com">Narelle Oliver</a>, were both at the launch today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/peter-carnavas-squigglemum.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5920" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/peter-carnavas-squigglemum.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I have <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/book-of-the-month-the-great-expedition/">reviewed</a> <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/author-illustrator-peter-carnavas/">several</a> of Pete&#8217;s books before, and always rate them highly.  Peter spent time with the kids at the launch today teaching them how to draw an illustration.  He explained that if you can draw a circle, a line and a dot &#8211; you can draw anything!    It was wonderful to watch a bunch of kids drawing comical sharks together.  Even my 3yr old had a go!  Peter also talked with the kids about how an illustration has to involve more than simply a character.  An illustration must tell the story.  Check out the &#8220;story&#8221; below&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/peter-squiggle-kids.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5921" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/peter-squiggle-kids.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="420" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">It was such a delight to also meet award winning illustrator <a href="http://narelleoliver.com">Narelle Oliver</a>.  I have long been a fan of Narelle&#8217;s work as it often focuses on Australian animals in their natural habitats.  Her linocut prints are a distinctive trademark, and provide a wonderful opportunity to talk with kids about different ways artists create their illustrations.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Miss 5 was so excited when Narelle pulled a stowaway Thingamajig out of her bag, as this creature currently features all over her classroom wall at school!  The Very Blue Thingamajig was relieved to find that yes, he IS on one of the <em>Read Up</em> certificates.  The five <em>Read Up</em> certificates are beautifully designed artworks in their own right, and definitely worth collecting.  In addition to Narelle and Peter, the other contributing artists are Kerry Argent, Gregory Rogers, and Clare McFadden.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Your local library really is a treasure trove of top quality Australian picture books.  These amazing certificates might be just the inspiration <del>you</del> your children need to head to the library this week. Happy reading!</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/little-treasures-cover-sheet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5677" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/little-treasures-cover-sheet.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="242" /></a></p>
<p><strong>To celebrate the launch of New Frontier&#8217;s Little Treasures Collection, I am delighted to have been able to interview Pete himself.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>:  <em>Last Tree in the City</em> is my favourite of your published works. Do you have a favourite?</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong>:  It is always difficult to pick a favourite book as there are things I like about all of them (and some things I think I could have done better but I won’t mention those).  My sentimental favourite is <em>Sarah’s Heavy Heart</em> because it’s a different, dreamy sort of story.  It is the only story that really started with an image (of a girl carrying a big heart on her back) rather than the text or idea.  I’m quite happy with all of the illustrations and I am proud of the layers of meaning I put into that story.  Also, it’s dedicated to my wife so, really, it’s the most romantic of my tales.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong> &#8211; Which of your characters is most like you and why?</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong> &#8211; I’ve always thought the tortoise in <em>Sarah’s Heavy Heart</em> was a bit of a self-portrait.  I identify a lot with Sarah and the tortoise because I feel like I do things quite slowly and quietly and sometimes envy the spontaneity of others.  Without really meaning to, I’ve created most of my characters so they are a bit like me – quiet, generally keep to themselves, big noses.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong> &#8211; So as an author/illustrator, which comes first for you &#8211; the words or the pictures?</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong> &#8211; I think of an idea for a story first then pictures start popping into my head, though I don’t tend to draw anything until I’ve written the text.  As I write, I have the images in mind the whole time so it’s difficult to work out what comes first.  My goal is to make both elements interdependent in the finished story so it’s the same for the process.  The words and pictures bounce off each other the whole time, whether it’s in my head or on the page.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong> &#8211; And how long does the process of developing a picture book take?</p>
<p><strong>Pete</strong> &#8211; It generally takes somewhere between three and six months, inbetween doing everything else in my life.  I spend a few months drawing roughs, then a few months painting the final illustrations.  Once all of my work is done, the design, printing and distribution will take another six months so it can be around a year from the moment I start on a book to the moment I’m reading it to children at schools.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong> &#8211; Finally Pete, what are your &#8220;tools of the trade&#8221; as an author/illustrator?</p>
<p>As an author, I like a pencil and notepad.  My stories are quite lean on words so it’s not too demanding for me to write them out with a pencil.  When I’ve finished the text, I’ll type it out and it’s done.  As an illustrator, I draft everything using an A2 sketchpad and have recently enjoyed drawing with very light pencils, H or 2H.  When it comes time to paint, I have traditionally used Arches medium watercolour paper, though I’m currently having a go using Saunders – thick enough, with a little less grain, making it easier for my ink outlines.  I only use about three or four brushes, with tubes of watercolour paint.  To finish off, I ink the outines with a few different nibs dipped into a jar of ink (the jar used to hold poppy seeds).</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/treasures-set.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5678" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/treasures-set.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>﻿﻿</p>
<p><strong>Thanks so much Peter.  I look forward to your next picture book <em>Mr Darcy</em> being released shortly too!  Oh, and if you are thinking of creating a curly-haired, big nosed character any time soon&#8230; let me know <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have long had the idea of putting an actual letterbox in the backyard for the kids to use.  FINALLY I got around to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5443" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p>Letter writing is such a great, purposeful literacy activity.  It provides a reason to write, and an incentive to write <em><strong>well </strong></em>because you want the recipient to be able to read their letter when they receive it!</p>
<p>I picked up this letterbox from our local (big green) hardware store for around $12.  It&#8217;s nothing fancy, but it does the job perfectly and we don&#8217;t need to worry about it being able to withstand the conditions outside.  We simply screwed it to a low, existing sleeper wall beside the dirt kitchen.</p>
<p>It has already been more than worth the money!  The kids have written so many letters to each other, to Mummy and Daddy, and to friends who have come over to play.  Writing them is fun, reading them is fun, checking the mailbox is fun, and delivering the mail is fun. Of course, everyone participates at their own level.  Miss 5 has been doing some great early writing, using her sound-letter knowledge to have-a-go at writing independently.  She has also worked hard to decode the simple letters I have posted to her.  Mr 2 has enjoyed being the mailman, and posted some excellent scribbles to his sister!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox-coll.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5444" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/letterbox-coll.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="484" /></a></p>
<p>If you are looking for an inexpensive, non-permanent, interactive addition for your backyard or playspace&#8230; try a letterbox!  It provides a lovely way for siblings or parent-child to communicate, promotes early reading and writing, and gets kids outside. Ticks all my boxes <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
