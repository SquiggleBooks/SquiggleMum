				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;right&#8221; way to teach young children to read has been up for debate this week, following NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli&#8217;s announcement that universities will be required to teach phonics to preservice teachers. (See this article via <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/education-minister-orders-universities-to-teach-phonics-or-face-losing-accreditation/story-fni0cx12-1227019125456?nk=05c34a3558a9475e26ca1faa2730345c">The Daily Telegraph</a> for the story).<span id="more-6786"></span></p>
<p>I did my B.Ed in the mid nineties &#8211; and must admit that I learnt very little about <em>phonics</em> in my degree. (<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Although out on prac, I encountered a range of phonics programs adopted by schools.) </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I did however learn a great deal about </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">whole language </em>in my undergrad subjects,<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> and about the constructivist approach to reading instruction which has greatly impacted my teaching. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/teaching-teachers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6796" alt="teaching teachers" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/teaching-teachers.jpg" width="558" height="431" /></a></p>
<p>In my opinion, there shouldn&#8217;t be a <em>phonics</em> vs <em>whole language</em> war, because it isn&#8217;t necessarily either / or. And the truth is, when it comes down to classroom teachers &#8211; there ISN&#8217;T a war. We are all saying the same thing: <strong>our students need both</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Phonics are important. The ability to make sounds from symbols enables the reader to attempt unfamiliar words. But an understanding of whole language is important too because reading is about more than just sounds &#8211; it&#8217;s about making meaning. If you read but don&#8217;t understand, what&#8217;s the point? </span></p>
<p>I threw this topic out to my colleagues and readers (without giving my opinion), and unsurprisingly their comments confirmed my suspicions. Good teachers know that phonics are important. They also know that not all words can be sounded out, and that meaning can lie beyond graphemes. Here are some of their thoughts:</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/readers-thoughts-phonics.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6791" alt="readers thoughts phonics" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/readers-thoughts-phonics.png" width="502" height="508" /></a></p>
<p><strong>So here is my summary:</strong></p>
<p><em>Dear Universities. Please incorporate phonics into undergrad teacher education, but don&#8217;t ditch the great stuff you are already doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Dear Teachers. Please keep being amazing, and continue adapting your methods to suit the needs of your learners. </em></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Dear Goverment. Please be careful what you mandate. Rarely, if ever, is a single methodology better than a multifaceted approach, and we could lose more than we gain.</span></em></p>
<p><em>Dear Parents. Please don&#8217;t get drawn into the media-fuelled, government fed  debate. Just keep reading aloud daily to your kids. It has more impact than you can possibly imagine. </em></p>
<p><strong>Any further thoughts you would like to add&#8230;?</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When meeting author/illustrator <a href="http://www.narelleoliver.com">Narelle Oliver</a> at the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/2012-national-year-of-reading-read-up-launch/">Read Up launch</a> recently, I <em><strong>might</strong></em> have mentioned that Miss 5 and I are kind of into birds&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;which of course lead us into a discussion about Narelle&#8217;s award winning picture book, <strong><em>Fox and Fine Feathers, </em></strong>with her signature linocut illustrations.<span id="more-5982"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5983" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Lyrebird, Coucal, Pitta and Nightjar are birds of the forest floor. Although as different as groundbirds can be, they always look out for danger and warn each other to hide. One day, Lyrebird, Coucal and Pitta forget to look out for Fox. Only Nightjar is watching. Can he warn the others in time?</em></p>
<p>We loved learning more about these four beautiful Australian rainforest birds from the story:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superb Lyrebirds</strong> are incredibly shy creatures.  They are rarely seen, but often heard as they mimic the calls of other birds.  Males have long, intricate tail feathers.</li>
<li><strong>Pheasant Coucals</strong> are sizeable black and brown birds. They are not particularly adept at flying, so prefer to run after their prey.</li>
<li><strong>Noisy Pittas</strong> are brightly coloured little rainforest birds.  They hop about in the undergrowth, and although quite common are not often seen.</li>
<li><strong>Long-tailed Nightjars</strong> are masters of disguise.  Their feathers are perfectly camouflaged amongst the leaf litter during the day while they sleep.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5986" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="313" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: left"></div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to talking about birds, we also discussed the problems introduced species, such as foxes, can cause to fragile ecosystems.  Other introduced species to Australia include cane toads, rabbits, and (feral) cats.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This picture book is not only a wonderful read, but is rich with opportunities to discuss habitats, birdlife, camouflage, predators and more.  Great for low to mid primary, and any kids with an interest in wildlife.  (For my teacher friends, Scholastic provide <a href="http://www.scholastic.com.au/schools/education/teacherresources/assets/pdfs/Fox_and_Fine_Feathers.pdf">Teachers&#8217; Notes</a> on <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for classroom use.)</div>
<p><strong>Courtesy of Narelle Oliver herself, I have a SIGNED copy of <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for one lucky SquiggleMum reader.  To enter, simply leave a comment below and tell me an Australian bird that your kids have seen in your area.  </strong>(It&#8217;s a great excuse to  look out for birds this week&#8230;)  One entry per person, Aussie residents only, comp closes Sun 18/3/12 8pm Qld time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-pitta2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5987" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-pitta2-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; If you adore Narelle&#8217;s work, prints from the book are available at the gorgeous <a href="http://www.marksandgardner.com/">Marks and Gardner</a> gallery online, or at their beautiful premises on Mt Tamborine.  Tell them SquiggleMum sent you <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></em></p>
<p>*I received a copy of the book from Narelle Oliver, but did not receive payment for this post.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">_____________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>This competition has now closed. Congratulations Judith. </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/treasure-hunt-pond.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5344" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/treasure-hunt-pond.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>There are lots of reasons why I love this activity, and why you should try it with your kids!</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s easy to set up.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s exciting!</li>
<li>It gets kids outside.</li>
<li>It provides a <strong>purposeful</strong> reading opportunity.</li>
<li>It can be modified for a range of ages.<span id="more-5343"></span></li>
</ol>
<p>If your child is at the beginning-to-read stage (like my 5yr old), keep your clues really simple.  I used the same short sentence on each clue. &#8220;Go to the _____________.&#8221;  <em><strong>Go</strong>, <strong>to </strong></em>and <strong><em>the</em> </strong>are all high frequency words, and this is an excellent way to use them in context.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/treasure-hunt-notes.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5345" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/treasure-hunt-notes.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">If your child is a more competent reader, increase the length and complexity of the clues.  A game like this really encourages your child&#8217;s reading as there is an inbuilt incentive!  They have to be able to read the clue, in order to find the next clue, which of course &#8211; needs reading too&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you have older children, you might like to get cryptic (especially if you&#8217;re a bit of a fan of puzzles and crosswords yourself).  Older kids may even like to get writing and set up their own treasure hunt!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/treasure-hunt-mango.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5346" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/treasure-hunt-mango.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">At the end of every treasure hunt of course, there has to be treasure.  The &#8220;treasure&#8221; doesn&#8217;t need to be fancy. Sometimes our treasure is morning tea wrapped in a box.  Sometimes it&#8217;s bubble mix for blowing bubbles, or a batch of playdough.  This time the treasure for Miss 5 was a little wooden table and two chairs for the fairy garden.  The set might have only been a couple of dollars from the cheap shop, but the tiny furniture is treasured indeed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/treasure-hunt-fairy-surprise.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5347" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/treasure-hunt-fairy-surprise.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>Have you ever set up a treasure hunt for your kids? </strong></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Mr 2 loves to make "cups of coffee" for visitors (or for his Dad) and this wooden set is perfect for him.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/lion_tiger_tea.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4734" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/lion_tiger_tea.jpg" alt="" width="504" height="504" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">There are lots of gorgeous teasets available for little girls, but ones that are gender-neutral, or suitable for boys, are quite hard to find.  I don&#8217;t want my son to think that kitchen things are just for girls!  Mr 2 loves to make &#8220;cups of coffee&#8221; for visitors (or for his Dad) and this wooden set is perfect for him.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">This week I helped him to take his &#8220;cup of coffee&#8221; play a step further, and set up a little table in his room.  The R-O-A-R sign was already on his bedroom wall so seemed the logical place for lions and tigers to catch up for coffee!  I must say the Big Cats were very well mannered. They even blew on their coffee to cool it down.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We might follow up this play with a trip to the library to see if we can find the classic 60&#8217;s picture book &#8220;<em>The Tiger Who Came To Tea</em>&#8221; as well.  It seems rather appropriate, don&#8217;t you think? (For another post related to this picture book, jump over to <a href="http://childhood101.com/2010/07/do-good-stories-ever-go-out-of-fashion/">Childhood101</a>).</p>
