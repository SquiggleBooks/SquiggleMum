		<description><![CDATA[I love, love, love this post!  I grew up surrounded by music because my Grandfather was a music teacher.  I believe that music really provides a lot of keys to pieces of literacy and works hand-in-hand with many of the concepts, a large one being listening.  And, if you think about it, when kids make up songs, they really are telling stories!!!  Thank you for such a great post!!!  :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is a great post ... my daughter, now 8 STILL likes to add her own words to well-worn songs. It is so fun to listen to her in the shower start, stop and restart her lyrics when she gets stuck looking for a rhyme. Thanks for this wonderful post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;ve brought back so many memories of sharing music with my children when they were younger. When they were toddlers, they used to run and dance around the room to favorite songs!

Music will always be something that brings us together. Whether it&#039;s playing musical instruments, singing, dancing, or just plain old listening together, it&#039;s something that truly connects us all. Like the air we breathe, and the books we read, it&#039;s an important element in every household.

Thank you for putting a smile on my face today!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, that is great and my daughter, although she has a speech delay and some developmental delays, also knows a lot of songs and sings them in tune and very well.  I think there is a lot to be said for the theory of multiple intelligences, and shows that for some children, learning through music will be something they really relate to more than with other areas.

		<description><![CDATA[We love singing too.  I am currently trying to introduce more of &#039;my&#039; music into our singing (and dancing) repertoire as I realised that I have no idea what music is currently popular as I never hear the radio in the car anymore (and to be honest I am a bit Wiggle-d out!)

		<description><![CDATA[Ah yes, singing and music is a wonderful joyful tool.  I often use a sing-song voice when I talk to my young children.

&quot;Sing, sing a song, make it simple, to last your whole life long.  Don&#039;t worry if it&#039;s not good enough, for anyone else to year. Just sing, sing a song.&quot;]]></description>
