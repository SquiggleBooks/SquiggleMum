		<description><![CDATA[Sounds like a great topic for a book - a great book to read as I&#039;m sure it will raise lots of questions.
And I will add that it is a very important message for girls (and there are health concerns involved) but I think there is a message for boys to learn too - about the power of the media to manipulate, and also about real women vs. media images of women.
