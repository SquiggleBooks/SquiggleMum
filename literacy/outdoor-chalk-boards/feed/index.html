		<description><![CDATA[I must be on the same wavelength as you Catherine. I literally just bought some marine ply for an outdoor chalkboard. Sadly as I was reading your blog I was alerted to the fact that I forgot to pick it up! Tomorrow... BTW I love Genevieve&#039;s idea but has anyone tried it? It&#039;s a bit more work than I anticipated but am willing to do it if I know it works!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This is as great idea as the warmer weather starts to appear...sort of (I am in Melbourne!).  I do have a tin of blackboard paint that I used to paint the top of one of the children&#039;s old wooden tables.  As you take it off your list I will add it to mine.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow! Thanks for the chalkboard tutorial and more-permanent chalk ideas.  This looks so inexpensive and easy, we will have to do it!

I think I would drill holes in the board, so you could tie it on the fence, and move it easily without leaving holes. I wonder if you could put a layer of magnetic paint under the chalkboard paint, so you could use magnets?]]></description>
