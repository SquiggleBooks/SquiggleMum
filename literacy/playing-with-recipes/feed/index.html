		<description><![CDATA[She did really well - we forget how much children pick up just from watching and helping through the years.
I bet she enjoyed eating them so much more than soething else that tasted great but she didn&#039;t make.

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;...I try not to do too much “teaching” with her at home. She’ll have plenty of that at school next year...&quot;

Thank you, thank you, thank you for including this quote in your blog... I&#039;m also a teacher and mum to a soon-to-be preppie.

I feel exactly the same way, but sometimes I&#039;m made to feel that it&#039;s laziness. Thank you for validating my decision not to formally &#039;teach&#039; my kids at home. They learn so much by watching and working alongside us, I love that home is a place where *they* run the learning!!!

I love the activities you do with your kids. While we cook often, I&#039;ve never let mine invent their own recipes... they&#039;re gonna love it!!!

		<description><![CDATA[What a fantastic (and yummy) idea! My daughter is a bit younger (3y3m) and probably not ready for this yet but I know she would love to be given free reign in the kitchen as she just loves baking.

Great job at sounding out the words, too. Looks like she has benefitted from the &#039;non teaching&#039; at home :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a wonderful idea !

My eldest son (also 4) helps cut up veges, mix cakes and even uses the really long tongs to help turn steak on the BBQ with his dad, but I know that he would struggle if given a task in the kitchen on his own.  Truthfully, I am a complete control freak in the kitchen (well anywhere to be honest) and probably don&#039;t give him enough opportunities.  Might be time for me to change that...

By the way, that photo of your daughter is priceless !  What a little cutie !]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amazing :) I am still uncertain as to what to let Princess do in the kitchen when we cook together. I help her measure (mostly because a wonderful friend bought her some matryoshka shaped measuring cups and they are hard to get into our ingredient containers) and let her add and mix ingredients, and then top with any decorations. I certainly don&#039;t think she is quite ready to work on her own though.

We will be back in our kitchen today and tomorrow, making Christmas cookies, and two puddings for our family meals over the next few days. Such a busy, busy time!]]></description>
