		<description><![CDATA[At home, my little one loves Caps for Sale (Esphyr Slobodkina).  She can sit with it for ages, turning over the pages and laughing at the monkeys in the trees.

In the classroom, my students enjoy the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (CS Lewis).

		<description><![CDATA[Julia loved the Very Hungry Caterpillar! Dion&#039;s favourite was probably Green Eggs and Ham. They both also enjoyed the Hairy Maclary book about Scarface Claw the cat ... probably because it was mummy&#039;s favourite and she used to get right into the sound effects ... rrRRRooooowwwRRRrr! said Scarface Claw. LOL!

		<description><![CDATA[Received a lovely book as part of my birthday pressie from a dear friend this week.  The book is &quot;Not a Box&quot; by Antoinette Portis.  A very simple picture book that says a lot without too many words.  My 10 &amp; 12 year olds have enjoyed this book and even took it to share with Grandma when we had dinner with her last night.  Being an early childhood teacher I just love picture books and as you can tell still occasionally get to share them with my big kids.]]></description>
