		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,

Looks like you guys had a great time at the ReadUp launch. The certificates are awesome.  I was hoping to go to Kerry Argent&#039;s book launch tomorrow but it&#039;s more for adults and I would have the two girls with me.  However, there is another talk about The Fabulous Finola Fox on Sunday 29th April with activities for children at the Marks and Gardener Gallery, North Tamborine.  Have you been before?  Looks like they&#039;ve got lots of great events on.  http://www.marksandgardner.com/

		<description><![CDATA[Oh - oh! that used to be our library system up in Queensland! Now I&#039;m all nostalgic again! I still look at the cards every time I open my wallet. (And very much meant to drop into the libraries when we were up on holiday in Jan... but I&#039;m not so great on getting things back on time so thought I&#039;d better not risk it!)  Yep - the kids both have cards - I think I got my Poppet&#039;s the week she was born... Looks like a lovely lovely day!]]></description>
