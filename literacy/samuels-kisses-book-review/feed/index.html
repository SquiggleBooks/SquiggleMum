		<description><![CDATA[It is such a beautiful book . Congratulations on the launch to Karen.

I would love to win this for my Samuel, 4, a little boy with the biggest heart who blows kisses and waves them off the back of his hand to everyone even the Dentist and O.T. or the supermarket checkout lady !

At FINAL bedtime goodnights - We &#039;sign&#039; the I love you and have a good tickle or hug and they pull me down again.
and I say God loves you. I often whisper to them I love you to the moon and back, and as much as all the stars too.They repeat it all muddled.

We hug many times a day just for no reason or to say thank you. I love this age of happy cuddles.Now we draw pictures on the whiteboard of hearts and x (kisses)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Whenever my husband or I are departing the company of our four year old (drop off to preschool, duck into town for a few minutes etc) she gets the normal good bye cuddles and kisses. As we walk off she races back to us shouting at the top of her voice &quot;Extra cuddles and kissies!!!&quot;. I love this as she doesn&#039;t care who hears her, it is really important to her. Just before we can no longer see her we sign to her &quot;I love you&quot; and she signs it back with the biggest smile. The best part is our 13 month old daughter is starting to do this too so we get twice the cuddle, kisses and smiles. Children bring so much joy!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To explain how our signal developed would take too long but when I tap my chest 3 times with the tips of my fingers held together my children know that I am saying I love you.  I can do this from across the room (especially if they are looking uncomfortable in a new situation) and they know what I am saying.  They also return the sign which is lovely.
I will keep an eye out for this book to purchase for my school library.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Oh, gosh! With 3 children under 6, I do all of the above. I am very conscious of being tactile with them whenever I can. They love it when I kiss them 50 times all over their faces before they go to bed. And our 18 month old Samuel would love this book! J x]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We most often say &quot;I love you&quot;, accompanied with kisses and cuddles. Sometimes we just sit snuggled up, not saying anything at all. But, there is nothing better than hearing my 22 month old son say &quot;I love you Mummy&quot;. :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous.  I once met an awesome illustrator and I was printing her work for her (I worked in a printing store).  It killed me not to ask for her number but it was against company policy - illustrators are true treasures.  As are authors, obviously.

Looks like a fantastic book.  We have so many ways to show our son we love him.  I have a little &quot;Briany Moo&quot; song which I sing to him.  I&#039;ve just revived it and now he calls me &quot;Mummy Noo Noo&quot; when he wants to show a little more affection.  We tell him daily how much we love him and today he finished the sentence for me, so I guess he knows just how much he is loved!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So happy for Karen&#039;s (and Serena&#039;s) book launch, loved seeing the photos.

Kisses and cuddles are always received and returned at my house, no matter what I&#039;m doing. We like to have tickle fights and fall in a heap laughing together. We have lots of kisses and cuddles throughout the day. And I say &#039;I love you&#039; several times a day to my kids just because. I never leave without a kiss and a cuddle and an &#039;I love you&#039; and bedtime involves reading a book together, then kisses, cuddles and one last &#039;I love you&#039;.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have a little game I play with my little boy, it goes a bit like this:
Mummy loves you up (lift him up high)
and Mummy loves you down (down low)
Mummy loves you in (hold close)
and Mummy loves you out (hold out from my body)
Mummy loves you round and round and round (turn in circles) lots and lots and lots (cuddle).

He laughs at this. But I think one day he&#039;ll get too heavy, and/or not want such a big fuss made!]]></description>
