		<description><![CDATA[LOL, I do the same thing. I always think, when watching my hubs with the kids, he must have learned how to do that from watching me. (I forget that HE is actually pretty good at tuning ME out.) Great post, though, hopefully it will make more parents aware of the great things they are already doing with their kids.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I used to try and entertain my son whilst reading and to make sure he was really listening, at the end of the story I would include really difficult questions pertaining to either the story or the pictures in the book. For instance, I&#039;d ask how many fishes there were when the Rainbow Fish was asked for one of his scales. Incredibly, young children can pick up so much more from a story book than just purely from what they pick up auditorily from you reading. Good story! :-) Colin
