<p>I was eavesdropping on my husband reading aloud to our daughter the other night, and I was very impressed.  He was doing so many great read-aloud things with a familiar and much loved book.  He paused to allow her to jump in with words she knew, he invited her to make predictions about the text, he encouraged her to investigate the illustrations for further clues, and he varied the volume and pace of his voice according to the story.  I smiled to myself as I listened in on their reading time.</p>
<p>When she was tucked in for the night and he finally emerged from her room I said, &#8220;Nicely done. Have you been listening to me reading that one with her?&#8221;  He looked at me blankly and said &#8220;Nuh?&#8221; with a shrug.</p>
<p><strong>It suddenly hit me how incredibly arrogant my question, and my thinking was.  My  husband wasn&#8217;t copying me.  He was using his own common sense! </strong></p>
<p>Sometimes as an educator I forget that you don&#8217;t actually need a teaching degree to be able to teach a young child.  There was so much fantastic teaching and learning going on in my daughter&#8217;s bedroom without a B.Ed in sight.  How did my husband know what to do then?  He simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>modeled good reading</li>
<li>shared the book with his child</li>
<li>engaged in meaningful conversation</li>
<li>made the book exciting</li>
<li>remembered the way he was read to as a child himself</li>
</ul>
<p>There are thousands of posts floating around the blogosphere telling parents how to read with their children.  Heck, I&#8217;ve even written some of them!  Ironic then, that the lesson I learnt this week about young children and reading came from within my own home.  The lesson?  Reading aloud <span style="text-decoration: line-through">isn&#8217;t</span> ain&#8217;t rocket science!</p>
<p>To all the parents (without a B.Ed) reading this, I want to reassure you that you don&#8217;t need any special training to do a good job of reading aloud to your child.  You have the tools you need, so just spend time with your child and a book every day.  Engage with your child, engage with the book, and let yourself enjoy it just a little.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; Sorry Honey.  Ego put back in its place where it belongs :-/</p>

					<p>I&#8217;ve just left bedtime story time and come to read this, and have to smile. It was a fight to be able to read a book (Dadda and Princess make up their bedtime stories, something I cannot do!), but we read one new book, and an old favourite. Both were so fun to read, and the bed was full of giggles and copying the actions of the story, linking it with what we have done today and what we will do tomorrow. It&#8217;s my favourite part of the day, and not just for the anticipated peace afterwards <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":D" class="wp-smiley" /><br />

					<p>Beautifully put.</p>
<p>I often envy my husband his actors training when reading as he can do lots of exciting voices and make the story seem so much more alive. But sitting together and cuddling while reading a good book is so much fun too.</p>

					<p>So simple. So true.</p>
<p>My hardest challenge was showing an interest in the books my child loved which I hated, like the Disney books. It was then I truly realised that there are children&#8217;s books for children and children&#8217;s books for adults&#8230;! The real winners are those that appeal to all ages.<br />

					<p>I remember reading that for kids one of the best things about hearing you read to them is simply the reassuring sound of your voice &#8211; I found it very reassuring that them being in my arms and listening to my (not so) dulcet tones was good enough!<br />

					<p>I used to try and entertain my son whilst reading and to make sure he was really listening, at the end of the story I would include really difficult questions pertaining to either the story or the pictures in the book. For instance, I&#8217;d ask how many fishes there were when the Rainbow Fish was asked for one of his scales. Incredibly, young children can pick up so much more from a story book than just purely from what they pick up auditorily from you reading. Good story! <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> Colin<br />
