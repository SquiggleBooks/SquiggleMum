		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree. I don&#039;t think kids have to understand every word to benefit from a story. Exposing them to rich and varied vocabulary from when they are young will pay huge dividends later with their literacy development.

We are bird lovers too. I am so pleased when i look on the &#039;net and find little audio files so I can check a song too.

		<description><![CDATA[I remember when I was little I loved looking in encyclopaedias and then asking my mum what the different things were.  My dream books were to win the set from Britannica on Sale of the Century; I wonder if my kids will dream of owning all sorts of books one day too?

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the great post, Cath.
&quot;Birds Build Nests&quot; looks like a beautiful book. In our house, Blake hears me read to Emma &amp; Logan from novels and even though they&#039;re not aimed at him, he takes things in from comments he makes.
I wish we&#039;d got that photo too! That would&#039;ve been great! That last workshop I was at went longer than I&#039;d thought. I hope there&#039;ll be other times in future.
Blessings,
Paula]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[When following a child&#039;s interest it amazes me the depth of knowledge they develop, with language and abstract concepts understood due to their fascination with the content.  It is true for us adults too, we learn much more easily when we are passionate about something!

		<description><![CDATA[Fabulous post.... my kids are all book lovers, especially the girls. We are probably reading a little above their level at the moment as they are heavily into chapter books and anything to do with fairies or imaginative creatures.... we are onto book three of four of the Little Fur series which often takes a little explaining but I can&#039;t believe how into it they are!
