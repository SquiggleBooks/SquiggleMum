		<description><![CDATA[Junk mail is the best for pasting.. not only is it full of familiar pictures it is also the perfect weight of paper - light enough to stick easily but shiny coated so it doesn&#039;t soak up the paste and become slushy!
Fabo!
Oh and Happy Birthday!!!

		<description><![CDATA[Happy birthday!

Bluing and cutting are two of my kids&#039; fav&#039;s, too.  and, circulars are great for these, I agree.  They also love using the charity mailing address labels as stickers.  Great for collaging and fine motor fun.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just love watching those little chubby hands hard at work! My daughter (now 27 months) has been using glue now for about 6 months. She still doesn&#039;t quite get the idea that the glue goes on the BACK of the picture, so needs some guidance, but gluing is always a hit here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Happy birthday, and I voted yesterday! :)

I can&#039;t remember when I started letting Princess use glue, but I am sure it was before she was two. Clag with the big brush, but mostly glue sticks as they were easier to use. And it was always under supervision (of course!)

Now, with two weeks until she is 4, she prefers sticky tape, and creates crafts unsupervised all the time. If I have to do dishes or vacuum she will disappear and do &quot;craft&quot;. I know I can trust her with what she is doing (as well as trust her to make a mess on the kitchen table right before dinner time with all her supplies!) and she is very happy and content doing it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, we go through gallons of glue each year, but we haven&#039;t had it out all summer. I&#039;m going to use this post as a reminder to break it out.

I wonder if someone from the US can vote for you. I&#039;ll head over and find out! =)

		<description><![CDATA[My children both used glue from a very early age, around the  same age as your Mr-almost-2.  In fact Tegan&#039;s first collage  was made while I was cardmaking and her little brother was sleeping.  She gave it to him and it stayed on his bedroom door for years.  Tegan (at 12) particulary still loves creating things, now she often uses the sewing machine to do this.
P.S. I have voted for you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m a childminder and start off with glueing as soon as I know a child can resist putting it straight in their mouth - probably just as they are coming up to 2yrs. I find glue sticks are really easy for them to grasp and use.
P.S. I love it if you could come and link up with our Play Academy on Fridays and help us promote learning through play :)
