		<description><![CDATA[We love treasure hunts too, but haven&#039;t done one for a while.  A few days ago we hunted for leaves and sticks to do a nature collage,and it would have made it even more fun to write the clues down for my son to read since he is starting to read for himself now, will try that next time, thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this idea :) we did an Easter egg hunt this year - it took a fair bit of pointing in the right direction, but  Miss 2.5 year old loved it. Though she kept thinking she would find eggs every time she went outside for a while after that!
She loves being outside, so I&#039;m thinking a pictorial backyard treasure hunt instead, with flashcard-like clues. Thanks for the inspiration!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This sounds like so much fun.  I once set up a treasure hunt for the kids at Playgroup - I followed an idea from Busy Brissy Mum by drawing the treasure hunt items on paper for the kids to mark off.  It was a big hit and something different to our usual Playgroup activity.  The last thing on the list was a &quot;present&quot;.  It contained a little collage making kit which the kids could do once inside.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Cool idea!  Thanks for sharing it with us.  To answer your question.  No I haven&#039;t ever set up a treasure hunt.

I even failed at easter, when having left a trail of little easter eggs my 7 year older confessed a few days ago that the easter bunny made a mistake.

She the explained that the trail of little easter eggs didn&#039;t lead to a pile of easter eggs (the treasure).

When she goes back to grandmas (the scene of the easter egg hunt), she retraces her steps each time in search for the elusive treasure.

However, with your inspiration I may attempt one tomorrow with some compass bearings included (my son&#039;s 10 and loves maps).

Cheers,]]></description>
