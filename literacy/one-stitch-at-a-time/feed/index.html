		<description><![CDATA[My kids love sewing with Mum but they&#039;re not up to projects of this depth yet. My classroom kids (year 5/6), however, would LOVE it. I can see a technology lesson plans writing themselves in my head when I look at this book! I&#039;m back in the classroom in July and am looking for motivational material to take with me :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My older girls would LOVE this! My mum taught them a lot of this sort of thing before she died, and I would love to be able to help them keep doing it, but I&#039;m not the craftiest person around. This would certainly help me encourage their passion without feeling too &quot;lost&quot; in the process.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My eldest son is 9 and has just got in to craft. He&#039;s seen us sewing &amp; mending clothes, and would like to try. This book would be fantastic for him, especially as he has a younger brother who loves soft toys (his pets) and this would be a great thing for us all to do together.]]></description>
