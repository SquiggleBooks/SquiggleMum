		<description><![CDATA[You are a blogging Queen! You now must come and have lunch with us - BBQ pizza is my current favourite (note: it tastes much more italian (i.e.authentic) and less american (i.e. fake) than it sounds). See you tomorrow :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[1. Spider-Man - find printable mask online; print, cut with added side tabs for head band, use political advertising / junk mail &amp; Stanley knife to cut eyes, add strips of cardboard to tabs for fitting to 5yr-old&#039;s head in the morning. Decide that 5yr-old can wear blue trackers &amp; a red long-sleeved shirt to make up the difference.

2. Kwazii&#039;s Grandfather from the Octonauts, whose name escapes me right now...features in the Octonauts Amazon Adventure...can u tell we watched it recently? Anyway...find printable pirate hat template, print, cut; use leftover strips for headband. Find printable belt buckle, print twice, once in yellow scrap paper, once on card; apply gold glitter / glitter paint again using political advertising as table cover, add leftover to pirate hat, glue pieces together. Find black track pants &amp; decide 7yr-old can choose whatever shirt he wants in the morning.

There you go, that&#039;s been my last two hours. Yes, it&#039;s 12:15am. Yes, both parades are Thurs, 9am &amp; 11:30. Yes I&#039;m supposed to be packing for conference tomorrow. Yes I&#039;m supposed to be sleeping right now. But there you go :-)]]></description>
