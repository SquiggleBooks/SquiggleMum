		<description><![CDATA[I just love the little table. It completely collapses down into three separate pieces, so stores flat when not in use. The top can be used on the green side or orange. I picked it up from the MTA clearance place for a bargain price. About $20 I think!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Cath, I&#039;ll be on the lookout for something like that. My son is happy to play with the pink and &quot;girly&quot; teaset at the moment (at 18 months of age), but I&#039;m sure that won&#039;t last!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad you could find a gender neutral tea set!

Tea parties are currently Emma&#039;s flavour of the month so she is having a tea party for her 4th birthday! I am going to go to op shops to get some cup and saucers for the little girls, and hopefully some mugs for the little boys she has invited!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have the same issue with my son.  His Nana gave him a kitchen but the tea set that came with it was poor quality and has already broken.  Everything in the stores is pink!  Wood is a fantastic long lasting alternative.

I&#039;ll second that love for the your son&#039;s table.  Love the colours and it&#039;s oh so cute.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think all children should have a tea set and I agree that this is a great alternative for a toy which predominantly seems to come in pink!  I love his table too, where did you find that?

Thank you for the link back xx]]></description>
