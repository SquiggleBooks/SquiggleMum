		<description><![CDATA[Awww! Gorgeous photo of the three of you :) My kids have always loved playing cafes and restaurants. Kiddicinos are a favourite, with hundreds and thousands on top, as well as rooibos tea with milk and honey. YUM!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cathie,
You know, I&#039;ve never thought about these questions myself. Those are pretty insightful questions to ask about play. Thanks for sharing, I&#039;ll have to think about this the next time I pour out &#039;tea&#039; for my toddlers too!
Ronnie xo
p.s. How&#039;s the bag going? :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s lovely. Also, you have given me an idea..since my 5 year old son doesn&#039;t join in tea parties with my 22 month daughter and I, maybe we could have camomile tea or hot chocolate next time.  After all its all about being together and having fun! I know what we are doing after school tomorrow!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our kids have mini-mugs which they use when enjoying &#039;coffee&#039; with us (theirs have unsugared, warm milo instead of moccona). They will often sit at the table after kindy and have &#039;coffee&#039; together while they discuss their favourite shows (much like me and their daddy do). Yesterday they discussed their wedding (teehee) while they had ice-cream sundaes they made themselves. I love watching them enjoy a drink/meal together in their own little world. Makes them feel grown up and is practise for life in the great-big-outdoor-world! I always think play is just practise anyway :) Practise sharing, using manners, negotiating, enjoying the moment :) I love seeing you interact with your kids, Squigglemum!!! Always motivates me to stop and smell the roses along the way :)]]></description>
