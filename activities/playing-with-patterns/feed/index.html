		<description><![CDATA[Cut pieces of fruit make for good patterning - my helpers just love adding those bite sized pieces to lunchboxes, too :) Little Miss loves making patterns with our bag of buttons too - you can pattern by size (big, small), colour or shape. Hours of fun for everyone :)]]></description>
