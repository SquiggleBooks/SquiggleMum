		<description><![CDATA[We don&#039;t have a train table, I did have a really nice one that I found at a second hand shop for $7!!! I just found we could play with his whole set. We have lots of wooden train sets, plus we have the Plan City Road networks that link up with a train set. So instead I went to Lowes got a sheet of MDF, painted it green, painted some lakes on it and it stays under the bed until the train set and Plan City road comes out. Using this also means he can have it set up in his room on the carpet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Well, just to be the odd one out...

We have a train table and we love it! Once every few months we construct a big layout &#039;as it came&#039;, but within a day it has been deconstructed. We have had playdough mudslides, block towers, random farm animals and all kinds of weird and wonderful additions.

Table or not - kids can be creative, if they are allowed to be. The table just minimises the chance of me tripping over a carefully laid train track, and for a few months gave the 2 year old a chance to play out the baby&#039;s reach!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our boys also play trains so much better on the floor. We do have a table that we picked up for $70 at Aldi and it&#039;s great. But you know what, it sits outside now, occasionally rained on and ignored.

Tracks on the floor are messier sure. And it&#039;s a mess that tends to hang around if you have boys like mine that play trains all. the. time. But still, if you relinquish this anxiety, it&#039;s really quite beautiful to watch their floor time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We got our little man a beautiful wooden train set for his 2nd birthday and he just adores it. We set it up on the floor too and it was wonderful. I love having it on the floor, he has so much freedom of movement. We added a city and a forest too from some chalkboard blocks I made for him. I do love your little pond though and will be adding that next time we pull it out. Just lovely.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have to admit that our train set gets quite neglected. It&#039;s time to bring it out again I think. I like the way you have made pond&#039;s etc..very inspiring.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[For a while I was desperate for the time when our biggest boy had a bedroom of his own (ie not sharing with me and his dad and his baby brother like he is now!) so we could have one of those under bed train table things.... But the more I thought about it, the more I thought it wouldn&#039;t work at all for us as our train tracks are always built MUCH bigger than even an under bed table!

I LOVE your fabulous train set up... my boy sat here earlier today and eyed off a few things he wants to try!

Oh but I think one of those underbed systems would be great for lego.... that way my kids would have somewhere to build and not have to pack it up all the time!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I totally agree.  We are a on-the-floor train track family with farms, Little People sets, books to raise it up, washers to make it bumpy etc etc added.
I have a few friends who always make the track for their kids and/or glue it down but half the fun we have is in the making, and has been even when he was 1.
My son in particular has learnt creativity and engineering with the different tracks and loops he makes .  He often wants me take a photo of the &quot;new&quot; tracks he has created.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love all your additions! We have a train set, and a table - but the table is used for all sorts of play - so we put it up and take it down quite often (right now the train set it put away to give him a chance to find other fun toys) - but we&#039;ve never added buildings/scenery to it yet - i love your simple ideas! Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I watched as so many of my friends bought train tables/trays and some even permanently glued the track in place.  They all &#039;pitied&#039; me that we could not or did not have a train table but I think it is the best non-purchase we ever made.   I love seeing the different tracks that my boys create and the unusual places the tracks lead to.
Great blog.]]></description>
