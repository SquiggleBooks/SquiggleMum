		<description><![CDATA[Yes I&#039;ve done this too for my kids and they play with their bean bags for hours! I did different patterns for each child because they were quite possessive of &quot;their&quot; bean bags. I&#039;ve made them for nieces too and my friend&#039;s kids when she had her 3rd baby.

(http://lovingmums-lovingmums.blogspot.com/2009/07/creations.html)

Love them with the numbers too. I&#039;ll have to make more now!

		<description><![CDATA[Sad to say, spotlight did not have ready printed squares with numbers on them.  I was being hopeful!  Back to the sewing cupboard to see what I can come up with.   Im glad they are filled with rice and not some exotic bean.

Thanks for the ideas for games to play once we have some beanbags.
