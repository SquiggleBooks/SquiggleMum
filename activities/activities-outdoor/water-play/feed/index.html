		<description><![CDATA[Yes we do all of these! Water play is regular at our place. Buckets/containers of water get filled up, sponges, clothes, measuring cups come out. We fill up the sink, put on aprons &amp; the kids &quot;do the dishes&quot;. Cleaning the windows. Also paint brushes &amp; water are used to paint the fence. Then there is just the good old kiddy pool.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yes, we often do the slip and slide or sprinklers here.  Other ideas are Spray bottle with water so they can &quot;clean&quot; their bike/wall etc.
Washing the car can be wet fun.
Fill drums/clam shells/mini pool with water and let them go - even 8 yr olds love it.
I&#039;ve often got out the tea set with water and cooled cooked spaghetti (lots of play and eating options usually follwed by spaghetti throwing fight!
&quot;Swim&quot; in the bath with cold water.

Enjoy your week of eased restrictions!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember those days too!  We don&#039;t even own a sprinkler but would love to run through one with my little man.  I use some plastic ikea boxes and put them on a table outside, then fill with water for water play.  I love the idea of &quot;painting&quot; with just water and a brush too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We bought a slip n slide last summer and the girls have been asking to get it out again.  I even had a go one really hot day (in my clothes) and we ended up with half the neighbourhood kids in our backyard.  Lots of fun!]]></description>
