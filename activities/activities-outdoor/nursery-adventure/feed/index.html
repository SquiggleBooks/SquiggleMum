		<description><![CDATA[This is a lovely post. Our kids love to visit the nursery. At our local nursery there is an enormous tree section where they play hide and seek.Even my teenagers enjoy a visit, choosing their own plants for the garden.

Thanks for sharing.

		<description><![CDATA[What a lovely idea for an outing! I like the learning ideas you recommended too. I&#039;m not sure this would work with my 21 month old at the moment (the whole &quot;shop&quot; aspect is a bit of a worry - don&#039;t want to have to buy too many plants), but it is a great idea for the future. Thanks. PS - I found your blog through &quot;planning with kids&quot;]]></description>
