		<description><![CDATA[My kids found their own sink... I&#039;d put an old blue tub the previous owners had left under one of the drains ... and after every rain... there they are playing! I just have to be ultra careful to always empty it as soon as they finish. It&#039;s definitely one of their favourite toys! (P.S Your chalkboard idea was brilliant. The kids love it!)]]></description>
