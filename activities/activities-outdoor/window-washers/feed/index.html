		<description><![CDATA[My daughter took it upon herself to clean our front door window last night. Looks better now than it did before. She got all the toos herself. I figured - why not? It did need to be washed and it certainly wasn&#039;t going to get done by me and if it still needed to be washed after she was done with it I had lost nothing in the bargain.

		<description><![CDATA[I have found that kids love &quot;real work&quot;.  My eldest son went to a Montessori preschool and his favourite activities where always from the practical life area - shoe polishing, orange squeezing, cheese grating etc. I think he really valued seeing the outcome of his efforts.

		<description><![CDATA[I have great window washers (never very clean windows though lol)
I found if I gave them a spray bottle with just water and a cloth they could clean the inside without too much damage.
Now that I have an enjo window cleaner they do an even better job!  But sometimes they still want the spray bottle ...
Great post. :)

		<description><![CDATA[My daughter loves &quot;helping&quot; me do housework. This usually involves following me with a cloth and &quot;wiping&quot; here and there. The other thing she loves is using the dustpan and brush. We take turns sweeping and sometimes it is a struggle to get it back for my turn!

As they say, as soon as they can actually be helpful, they are not interested in helping anymore. I&#039;m enjoying the &quot;help&quot; while it comes so willingly!

		<description><![CDATA[Uncle Jason says he&#039;s happy to train then when they&#039;re ready to move to the next level!  It always amuses me when children play at things we as adults hate doing!  I remember as a kid playing &#039;house&#039; and &#039;shops&#039;.

On a more serious note, I susptect in this day and age it&#039;s important for children to learn how to amuse themselves without necessarily needing something to provide stimulation.  To be self-sufficient.  I had a friend the other say she couldn&#039;t take her children camping because they wouldn&#039;t survive without their playstation!]]></description>
