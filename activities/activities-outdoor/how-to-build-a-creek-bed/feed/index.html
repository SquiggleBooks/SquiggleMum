		<description><![CDATA[Hi! The creek bed has faired pretty well over the years.The black pond liner underneath meant that weeds were kept to a minimum, although some weeding was required if leaf litter from overhanging branches built up. As the kids played around the area we did find that rocks &quot;slipped&quot; down from the edges into the centre of the creek bed, so every few months or so I did a little maintenance moving them back out to the edges. The planting around the creek bed looked more natural over time too. Hope that helps! Cath.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello Cath,

I hope all is well in your garden.

I&#039;m considering doing just what you have done in your garden with the creek bed. How has it faired over the past few years?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Cath,  We&#039;re in the process of investigating dry creek beds and up popped your site.  FANTASTIC.  The price breakdown is a great help - though I think would probably be different in WA - still, a ballpark figure is a big help.  Love the idea to have the creek finish at a stone wall - we have one of those!!!  My kids are going to have a ball, they&#039;re a little older but still into playing and constructing - AND getting wet and muddy!
Thanks]]></description>
