		<description><![CDATA[Hi Marianne. It was actually concreted in to hold a large potplant. I removed the pot and used it as a puddle instead! You could make one with pondliner though (which I used in the dry creek bed post). Kids do love a puddle to splash in!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
Could I please ask: how did you make the water &#039;puddle&#039; with the stones at the top of this page? How does the water stay in there? Looking for a way to make a little water &#039;feature&#039; for my toddler to splash in. Would be grateful for any tips and advice. Thanks!

		<description><![CDATA[My kids love the rain. I can handle it if it&#039;s not too cold and windy, like on our recent school camp which ruined two expensive brollies. But I picked up a pair of funky rainboots for myself in the end of season sale (kids already have their own), so I&#039;m much happier sploshing around in puddles this time of the year.

		<description><![CDATA[We have a bit of a struggle with the rain. One of the grandmothers has taught my little one that you get sick if you go in the rain...I am trying to teach her that if we dress right with our gumboots (we loooove gumboots) and raincoat it is ok to go and play in the rain. There is very little in this world that is more fun than jumping in puddles!!!]]></description>
