		<description><![CDATA[I love your butterfly tree, it reminds me of a similar &quot;treehouse&quot; I played in with my cousins when I was growing up. It was just down the road from our beach house and we decked it out as a complete cubby house hidden from the world thanks to the overhung branches.  What a magical place, then and now.

		<description><![CDATA[What a beautiful idea. We&#039;ve got a tree in our backyard with low hanging branches. I think Riley would love it if we did something similar.

		<description><![CDATA[I know you say the photos do not do the butterflies justice but i think they are absolutely beautiful pics....the sun is shining through so nicely....

I love the little piece of magic you have created in your garden! Makes me think of pixie tea parties and Enid Blyton stories...

		<description><![CDATA[Cool idea to do a butterfly tree!
Colorful, festive, and fun!
We have Monarchs that migrate up from Mexico into the United States for the Spring and Summer, along with other cool butterflies here.
Stopped by via the We Play Link ups at Childhood 101. Hope that you will pop by my blog.
