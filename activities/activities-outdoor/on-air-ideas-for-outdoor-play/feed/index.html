		<description><![CDATA[I heard through the grapevine that you had been on the radio.  Well done!

I agree completely.  Outside play rocks !  We have not bothered with a sandpit and instead the kids have a section of the dirt garden that they are allowed to dig in to their hearts content.  My 4 year old often &#039;plants&#039; twigs and leaves from nearby trees in there.  Very cute :)

Nearly everyone that visits our house seems to think this is odd, often making a point of telling us how cheap and easy it would be to just get a sandpit.

For us however, the dirt garden is a winner and I certainly won&#039;t be changing it anytime soon.

Nice to hear I am not alone :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Catherine

The Children &amp; Nature Network also have a Ning site that acts as a forum to share and exchange ideas on all sorts of outdoor and nature based play...http://childrenandnature.ning.com/

Another wee reference (from Scotland but I think fairly applicable world wide is the advice on outdoor play and learning on the Centre for confidence and Wellbeing http://www.centreforconfidence.co.uk/flourishing-lives.php?p=cGlkPTE3MyZpZD02NjY

Best wishes
Juliet
