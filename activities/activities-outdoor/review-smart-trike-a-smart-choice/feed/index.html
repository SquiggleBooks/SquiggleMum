		<description><![CDATA[Looks like a great first bike ... we are such a biking family that my Miss 4 is just about to get her second bike for Christmas this year .. the first one was great from age 2 until now so think we did well.  You will have to consider a bike for Miss 4 now too.  Biking is such a great family activity too ... Enjoy!]]></description>
