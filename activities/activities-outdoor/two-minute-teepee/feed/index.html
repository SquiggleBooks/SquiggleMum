		<description><![CDATA[Hi...I made one from scratch..sewing and all from just scrap material and bought the poles from Bunnings....I am not great at making things like a teepee, but was happy with the outcome and my Lily loved it...

practical for us cause can pack it away when she is finished playing in the house or the garden...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Sherry and Donna from Irresistible Ideas for Play based learning have a lovely photo of their sandpit teepee which makes a great wee cubby. The tyre keeps the poles from collapsing too. Here&#039;s a link to the post I wrote that includes the photo: http://creativestarlearning.blogspot.com/2010/07/sandpits-outside-roar.html

Thanks for another super post!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes, mine would love it. I can sew but I like the idea of the kids putting it together, that&#039;s half the fun isn&#039;t it? No idea on lashing poles together, so I&#039;m all for a tutorial on that (no kidding), and note to self: must put kids in girls guides and scouts :-)]]></description>
