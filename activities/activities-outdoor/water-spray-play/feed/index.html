		<description><![CDATA[Great post!
Up here in Cairns we are just looking forward to the end of the wet season.  Totally sick of the rain, at least it is hot though.
We had a recent party and enjoyed the traditional polythene, water and hose slide!

Awesome fun all round.

Feel free to drop past our kid friendly blog with ideas of resources when you have a chance.

		<description><![CDATA[I love that your kids just kinda came up with this on their own and it wasn&#039;t planned - those are the best! And it looks like it would be so much fun!

I would love it if you linked this up to our new &quot;It&#039;s Playtime&quot; party today.
