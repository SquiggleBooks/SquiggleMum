		<description><![CDATA[Living on the &quot;Koala Cost&quot; here are some tips: the colder it is, the higher up in the trees they go. They don&#039;t always stick to gum trees - we have one that regularly spends the day snoozing in a camphor laurel tree! And if you do have one, you will hear the grunting at night especially during mating season ...

		<description><![CDATA[Oooh... Janet the kids would be SO excited if we had a resident koala.  I haven&#039;t ever seen one in our yard, but that doesn&#039;t mean one couldn&#039;t move in!  We&#039;ll keep our eyes peeled and definitely put a post up when we find the creature responsible for the scratches and scats.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love this post: we go through the same thing at preschool.  We have never seen our possum(s) but we know they are there - especially when we forget to empty the food bin outside and have the pleasure of arriving at preschool to the bin on its side and rubbish everywhere.
