		<description><![CDATA[How cool to do a bamboo maze! Looks like fun! We have never done a bamboo maze, but did do a corn maze back when we lived in Virginia.
Popped by your neat blog from the We Play link ups. Hope that you will pop by my blog to say hi, too. Havea nice weekend,
Colleen

		<description><![CDATA[Wow what a cool looking place! We&#039;ve only visited a maze once while on holidays in Victoria, but our eldest was too young to really enjoy it unfortunately. I would love to take both my girls back there now that they would be old enough to really enjoy it! I&#039;ll have to do some Googling and see if we have any around here.
