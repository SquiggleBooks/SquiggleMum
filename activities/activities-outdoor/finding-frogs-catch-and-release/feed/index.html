		<description><![CDATA[It is lovely for children to be able to catch frogs in their very own backyard (cane toads are a different story altogether!).  Loving the little habitat you made for him.

My oldest son loves frogs - he wants to be an amphibean biologist when he leaves school (yes, there is such a thing apparently).  We listened recently to one speak on frogs and she said that it is great to take kids out into the backyard at night with torch headlamps to hunt for frogs and follow their calls because that is when you will be most likely to find them.

		<description><![CDATA[lovely ...loved Marshmallow story.
A very interesting learning experience and lesson in kindness to animals .

My husband found some frogs (12) in the toilet cistern at the farm. He put them in my tupperware container (uh oh) and then we took the boys on a moonlight walk down to the dam to relocate them.They were just brown frogs and I didn&#039;t have my camera (pity).
The toilet at the farmhouse 5km away has huge GReen frogs who jump out when you go for a &#039;twinkle&#039; in the middle of the night ...now I turn the light on LOL
