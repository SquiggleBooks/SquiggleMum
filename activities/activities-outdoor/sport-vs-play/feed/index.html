		<description><![CDATA[Play is incredibly important and many parents make the mistake of putting kids in sports and thinking it is play time. Play is child-centered and child-directed, and organized sports are anything but. Sports have value, of course, but should come later in childhood. Kids seem to be starting earlier and earlier -- before they have learned the fundamental motor skills which come through unstructured play but also through structured, developmentally appropriate movement experiences &amp; play activities guided by a teacher, caregiver or parent. These experiences will form the basis for everything -- sports, dance and physical recreation pursuits into adulthood.

		<description><![CDATA[Other than swimming, my eldest two didn&#039;t start group sports until two years ago, when my eldest was 7. Until then, we had fun and developed lots of great relationships through MOPS, church, the library and with other families by hanging out at the playground after school.

Currently Mr. 9 has piano lessons, and attended his first first in2cricket session last week, which he absolutely loved! During that time our girls had a lovely time running and dancing on the grass. It has a lovely community feel about it, with a sausage sizzle afterwards, and the opportunity to hang out with classmates and other acquaintances in a different setting.

Miss 6 loves her ballet, and Miss 3 tags along. They&#039;ve made some good friends in our neighbourhood, so we want them to have to opportunity to play with them. The logistics and cost of activities for three kids makes it difficult for us to do too much, so it allows the kids lots of time for free play, which we like.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are so blessed to live at the end of a cul-de-sack where all the children play in the &#039;old-fashioned&#039; way most afternoons and every weekend. I love seeing the simple fun in riding bikes, climbing trees and drawing hopscotch on the road. This to us is a very important part of our days. Thanks Squiggle Mum for keeping the importance of outdoor free play at the top of our list of &#039;must-do&#039; activities!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Now my children are at school I encourage one organised sport each at a time (currently it is swimming - same reason as Ros above) but in the middle of the year it was netball for one, soccer for the other.  I like to still have time for playdates and of course, free time.  My children spend a lot of time outside after school on the trampoline/swings, playgrounds (our place is on edge of school property), making cubbies in the bush with the neighbour&#039;s children.  I would also love them to do music/piano lessons but there is a lack of teachers here.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Our girls do swimming and ballet - swimming because we think that&#039;s essential living where we do, and ballet for my youngest&#039;s feet, we were referred there from a podiatrist. They love both, but they also love jumping on trampolines, making up games in the backyard and going crazy with dress ups and make believe games as well. We watch very little TV (perhaps a little on a weekend and that&#039;s all), which helps to fit it all in.]]></description>
