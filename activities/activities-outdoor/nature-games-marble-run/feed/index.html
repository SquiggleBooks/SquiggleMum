This is how I remember playing it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve sat and thougth about this Catherine and I have nothing - sorry!  Your idea of the outdoor marble run is extremely creative.  We own a marble run which I picked up in a fill a bag for $2 deal at an op shop.  It is greatly loved in our house, especially when Daddy plays too.  He helps to make the best ones.  Can&#039;t wait to hear more outdoor ideas.
