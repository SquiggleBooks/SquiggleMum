		<description><![CDATA[What a surprise to find my name on your blog today!  Thanks for the link.

I love that you got me thinking about my own comment.  When I wrote it all I could think of was how our backyard has nothing but a boring strip of grass.  But really we have rocks down the side, clover and flowers (albeit from weeds!), and leaves blowing in from the neighbour&#039;s property.  So really when we have nothing, we actually do have something.  It&#039;s really just encouraging the kids to use those things.

		<description><![CDATA[We have plenty of &#039;loose parts&#039; and I too (now) love allowing the kids to play to their imagination&#039;s content.  I&#039;ll admit though, that it has been hard to &#039;let go&#039; and just let them play &amp; discover.  A lot of people I know would probably &#039;tut tut&#039; me for allowing it!

It&#039;s also a shame that people need to be encouraged to let their children discover the outdoors, when years ago, it was the most natural thing to do.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[awesome post! Loose parts have been on my mind lately too, and it&#039;s nice to read your validating thoughts. We have a bucket of rocks that have had multiple uses: a painting project, burying and then discovering them in the sandbox, sliding them into a pool of water, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Yes I do ...mainly about moving sand where it isn&#039;t supposed to be ;)  oh the flowers thing too.

We made a Teepee from old tree branches ...such a fun activity.

PS I wanted to build a dry creek bed ...and hubby wants me to enocurage the boys (&amp; I) to pick up the 1000+ rocks he thinks we require off the newly graded tracks LOL.
