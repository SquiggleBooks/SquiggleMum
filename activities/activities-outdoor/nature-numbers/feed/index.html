		<description><![CDATA[I think what I love most about a lot of your posts (like this one) is that they are opportunistic. You take a &#039;moment&#039; that your child has and you spontaneously create a learning experience around it. And I suspect given how much fun they typically are your children don&#039;t even reaslise they&#039;re learning either!]]></description>
