		<description><![CDATA[Lovely post! This is twice in a 100 year period flood for me. I live out west near St George and Dirranbandi... so we are well accustomed to the flood now! Thankfully, we are still all high and dry, and counting our blessings. My thoughts are with those less fortunate than ourselves.

Aside from the water issues, the whole rebuilding the infrastructure, replacing food on supermarket shelves and getting people to rebuild their lives will take many months and even years.

Lets stick together and do whatever we can to help everyone get through this as quickly as possible. xxx]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Glad to hear you&#039;re high and dry and that everyone in your family is safe. I&#039;ve been conscious of all the coverage and the sensitive nature of my daughter, in particular, who absorbs things and then stews over them... I&#039;ve not been turning the tv on until after her bed time because I just don&#039;t think she needs to see the devastation.

She did overhear me talking about it with another adult and was full of questions. We talked about flooding, what it was and where it was happening. She looked out the window at the pouring rain (it hasn&#039;t stopped for the last couple of days) and then I had to explain very carefully that it wasn&#039;t going to flood here!

It&#039;s an important issue you raise - there will be lots of little Queenslanders who are going to need to process this disaster happening in their world - long after the waters recede.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this Squigglemum. This flood has affected us in various ways: a sister in Gympie, a sister in law in both Toowoomba and Dalby, and a husband who works in Milton. Our eldest son is aware of the flooding, he has been asking us about his Aunty who is on an island in Dalby. Hubbys work in Milton is flooded also. I guess all he wants is the reassurance we will be fine, we are all safe. Even though Daddy&#039;s work is flooded, he doesn&#039;t have to go in the water. I think both sons feel like things are back to normal today, hubby went off to work at an alternative venue... I think to a 3 and 2 year old, things seem to be normal again.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for this.  My son has seen a lot on TV and been asked to keep quiet so we can hear updates.  So I wonder what affect it&#039;s had on him.  It&#039;s good to be reminded that he needs to process this in his own way too.  None of us have seen any of this for real, but we did pack up just in case we needed to leave early this morning.  Thankfully we are ok and it&#039;s not as high as we expected.  So many people are hurting from this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are safe too (Redlands) but I lived in NewFarm before and   I spent soo much time exploring Brisbane, via the riverside walk and the ferries. my son knows everything too but I saw he got a bit upset already from the first pictures from other regions. We talk A LOT about it, and I repeat again and again, that although now it all looks familiar, we are NOT in danger (that my husband already can&#039;t work kind of adds to his feeling of safety, but it&#039;s a bit of a worry) Even for big people these pictures are very upsetting. :(]]></description>
