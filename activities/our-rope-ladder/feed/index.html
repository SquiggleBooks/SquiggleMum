		<description><![CDATA[I wish we had a tree in the yard to do something like this.  Our bare backyard isn&#039;t much fun!  My brother would constantly fall out of trees as a child.  I love your tips about not helping the kids go higher than they can independently and falling is part of the process.  My son loves to climb a wooden ladder at Playgroup and lately I&#039;ve been the stand and supervise Mum, just in case one bumps their head or falls.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t have to encourage my boys to climb, they just want to do it all the time! But this is a fun way to challenge them a little. I&#039;ll have to remember this for when they get a bit older. Looks like your kids are having so much fun!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My son has a motor disability and we encourage him to climb as often as possible. He loves to climb (he&#039;s 2). One day hopefully he&#039;ll be climbing a rope ladder too :) Simple childhood pleasures.
Would love it if you popped over and shared this with our Friday Outdoor Play link-up :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;so creative to do thiat ladder.
I understand your idea when you write this post.
I also encourage my child stand on his own two feet because when he grow up, I can stand next to him to help him any more]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I definitely encourage them to climb. Our first was very fearful and we worried about his gross motor skills because he would not climb until he was about 4. Our second is fearless and while we have always encouraged them both to climb, I now realised I never needed to with him and I have to bite my tongue when I feel like discouraging him. I know it&#039;s important and I can tell it&#039;s also his way of asserting independence. He loves it!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great ladder Cath ; ) I can&#039;t believe how much your little man has grown up!!  Encouraging my kids to climb??  Ah...their daddy is a keen rockclimber so they just seem to do what daddy does.  Miss M (4) has worked out how to climb up the kitchen doorway and just balance there.  Crazy stuff!  I love that she can do it but I try to discourage her from doing it there.  I&#039;d LOVE an indoor climbing wall.  Our yard doesn&#039;t really have too much to climb on so kindy and parks are great places for my girls to explore and challenge their skills.]]></description>
