		<description><![CDATA[I love that games that are played during one on one times seem to naturally involve great learning and language opportunities. No need to be specific, just focus on the fun and learning happen :)

Of course my Miss 3 loves the attention the learning is just a bonus for mum]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is so much language stimulation that can come from old catalogues. I used to use them (as a Speech Pathologist) in categorisation (fruit, toys, clothes), looking for objects by their function (which one can cut?), describing (by colour, shape, size, number, texture), and matching games as you described. If you get the right pictures, they are also much more interesting for sound/ articulation work than using photocopied line drawings. Sounds like you had a nice afternoon!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I love these ideas!  What a creative use for catalogs.

Have to add that I hope it isn&#039;t too soon before she stops saying &quot;snissors&quot; because that is adorable  :-)

Best wishes!
