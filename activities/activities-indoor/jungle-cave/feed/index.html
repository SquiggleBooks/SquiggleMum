		<description><![CDATA[That is sooooo fantastic :)  My girls are really impressed by all the boxes in the house while we pack to move. Not so impressed that Mummy has banned playing with them until AFTER we move. But once in the new place there will be several play boxes set aside for them :D]]></description>
