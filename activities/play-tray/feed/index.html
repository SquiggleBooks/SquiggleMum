		<description><![CDATA[We just use (new)kitty litter trays from discount stores as small play trays At home we use garden beds the kids have selected plants and seeds and planted themselves,there is a dino land , bunny habitat, dora&#039;s Teepee and construction zone with coloured sand around our yard. The eldest begs cuttings and collects seeds from neighbours and visits to family for her Faerie garden and succulent colection. She also has been known to budget her pocket money to buy plants from bunnings and swap meets. Ms 10 and a pair of friend hop on bikes and go to garage sales together (without me !) and have been known to get free cuttings , yet pay for an interesting piece of drift wood to create a play scene or something sparkly for fairy house building.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This looks awesome.  Such boy fun.  Love the little hammer stamp on your son&#039;s hand from Bunnings too.

To answer your questions; we don&#039;t have a play tray.  And yes it looks like super, super fun.  2 year old and a hammer - I would hold my breath and give him a go.  I usually give my son two choices and let him choose his favourite.]]></description>
