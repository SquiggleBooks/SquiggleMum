		<description><![CDATA[Win tix to Justine Clarke's Pop Up Tour!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past few years as  blogger I have been able to work with some wonderful children&#8217;s authors and artists. One of my favourites is<a href="http://justineclarke.com.au"> Justine Clarke</a>, and I am always delighted to promote her music and concerts. <strong>This year I have TWO DOUBLE PASSES to her upcoming Pop Up Tour to give away to SquiggleMum readers. </strong>(Thanks Justine!)</p>
<p>Here are five reasons why I&#8217;m a fan:</p>
<p><span id="more-6124"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/justine_clarke_brisconcert.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3731" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/justine_clarke_brisconcert.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>She&#8217;s Australian</strong>. Sure, there are wonderful artists overseas as well &#8211; but I appreciate the Aussie accent and Aussie content in her work. When my kids sing along, they aren&#8217;t singing about zeeeebras or wellies <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></li>
<li><strong>She writes great songs!</strong>  I have heard so many other mums say that if they HAVE to have kids music playing in the car, they would rather it be Justine Clarke than anyone else. I have previously shared some thoughts about her music <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/top-songs-by-justine-clarke/">here</a> and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/top-songs-by-justine-clarke/">here</a> and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-interview-dvd-giveaway/">here</a>.  Oh, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-great-big-giveaway/">here</a>. Her music isn&#8217;t dumbed down for kids. It&#8217;s sophisticated musically while still being age appropriate.</li>
<li><strong>She performs &#8220;real&#8221; concerts</strong>. I enjoy seeing a real artist performing with real musicians, and I think kids do too.  Her setup is never OTT, and it doesn&#8217;t need to be because the music speaks for itself.  A live gig is a new experience for most kids.</li>
<li><strong>She cares about her little fans</strong>. She might walk the red carpet and receive nominations for acting awards, but she is never too busy for her little fans.  I&#8217;ve seen her stick around for a long time after shows to meet little ones, pose for endless photos, and accept lovingly drawn pictures of The Gumtree Family.</li>
<li><strong>She&#8217;s a mum</strong>. Just like us, she juggles her dreams with raising her kids.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/justine-popup-tour.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6125" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/justine-popup-tour.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="250" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t laugh. I might be all tech savvy with my iPad and iPhone and MacBook &#8211; but I cannot live without a paper diary!  I&#8217;ve always opted for a small one that I can keep in my handbag, but when I started working part time a few weeks ago I knew I needed to graduate to something more substantial.<span id="more-6074"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/innerb-open.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6077" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/innerb-open.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Hellloooo <a href="http://www.inner-b.com/">Inner B</a>!  I jumped at the chance to try out their Mum Organiser*.  Here are 5 things I LOVE about it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s robust.</strong>  I give my things a pretty good workout, and this diary is in and out of my bag several times a day. It&#8217;s really well made, the binder is strong, and I&#8217;m confident it will go the distance!</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s refillable.</strong>  Next year&#8217;s diary will only set me back $16.95 which is the cost of the 2013 refills.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s pretty.</strong>  I know that sounds shallow, but a visually appealing diary does help me to approach daily tasks more positively.  The Mum Organiser comes in three fresh shades.  No cutesy cartoons or tacky taglines here. Just good design and happy colour.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s well thought out.</strong>  I really like the monthly dividers, and the monthly overview at the start of each section. I also appreciate the week to a double page layout.  I cope with my <span style="color: #000000"><del>insanely</del> <del>ridiculously</del></span> busy schedule much better when I can easily scan a month or a week at a time.   The business card pockets at the front are great, plus I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s space for a pen to permanently live in my diary.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s made for me.</strong>  Well, not me exactly&#8230; but it is made for mums, with special consideration for things mums tend to write in their diaries.  And it is made for those Down Under, with Australian and New Zealand school holidays and public holidays marked. (Yay!)</li>
</ol>
<p>The only small criticism I have for the <a href="http://www.inner-b.com/">Inner B Mum Organiser</a> is that it is a little tricky to write close to the binder rings &#8211; but then again, without the binder it wouldn&#8217;t be refillable.  All in all I think this is a great product, particularly for mums like me who juggle part time work with full time parenting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/InnerB-Mum-colours-1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-6078" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/InnerB-Mum-colours-1.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="441" /></a>To celebrate Mothers Day this weekend, I have one Mum Organiser to give away valued at $44.95 thanks to the amazing Valerie Petersen at Inner B.  All you have to do is leave a comment sharing why YOU need a Mummy Organiser!  </strong></p>
<p>Competition is open to Aussie residents only. One entry per person please. Winner will be drawn at random on Sunday 20/5/12 8pm Qld time.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in other great products from Inner B, <a href="http://www.inner-b.com/">check out the notepads, planners and journals here</a>. You can also find Inner B on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/InnerB">facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/borganised">twitter</a>.  You&#8217;re welcome <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

		<description><![CDATA[5 outdoor activities using tin cans, plus win a MILO Play Kit]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very pleased to be an ambassador for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/miloausnz">MILO Play Movement</a> in 2012.  Play is a child&#8217;s work, and the importance of play in children&#8217;s development cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>MILO sent the SquiggleKids a fantastic play kit (final photo) to use in the backyard &#8211; and <strong>I&#8217;ve got one play kit to give away to a lucky SquiggleMum reader as well</strong>!  The kit contains soccer nets, cones, a selection of different balls and even a ball pump for your kids to use outside, plus a couple of tins of MILO.<span id="more-6036"></span></p>
<p>So of course, you know what my kids have had the most fun with, don&#8217;t you&#8230;?  <strong>The tins!!  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6041" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Kids have been inventing games with MILO tins for as long as MILO has been around. The labels might have changed, but not much else has. Here are 5 activities that are sure to bring back memories, and your own kids might like them too:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1.  Tin can stilts</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">2. Tin can telephone</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6043" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">3. Tin can bucket (on pulley rope)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6044" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">4. Tin can bowling</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6045" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">5. Tin can drums</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-drums.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6046" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-drums.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids have had SO much fun playing with a couple of tins. Sometimes I think commercial toys are entirely overrated.  That said, they were also pretty excited about this stuff:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6047" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>To win your own play kit thanks to MILO, just leave a comment below sharing what your kids like to play with in the backyard. Do they prefer sports-type activities? Imaginary games? Or creating their own fun with un-toys like mine?  </strong>[One entry per person please. Australian and New Zealand residents only. Winner drawn at random on Monday 23/4/12 8pm Qld time.]</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>Disclaimer: I receive payment for consulting services as a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/miloausnz">MILO Play Ambassador</a>, and received the MILO Play Kit free of charge.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When meeting author/illustrator <a href="http://www.narelleoliver.com">Narelle Oliver</a> at the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/2012-national-year-of-reading-read-up-launch/">Read Up launch</a> recently, I <em><strong>might</strong></em> have mentioned that Miss 5 and I are kind of into birds&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;which of course lead us into a discussion about Narelle&#8217;s award winning picture book, <strong><em>Fox and Fine Feathers, </em></strong>with her signature linocut illustrations.<span id="more-5982"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5983" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-cover.jpg" alt="" width="378" height="500" /></a></p>
<p><em>Lyrebird, Coucal, Pitta and Nightjar are birds of the forest floor. Although as different as groundbirds can be, they always look out for danger and warn each other to hide. One day, Lyrebird, Coucal and Pitta forget to look out for Fox. Only Nightjar is watching. Can he warn the others in time?</em></p>
<p>We loved learning more about these four beautiful Australian rainforest birds from the story:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Superb Lyrebirds</strong> are incredibly shy creatures.  They are rarely seen, but often heard as they mimic the calls of other birds.  Males have long, intricate tail feathers.</li>
<li><strong>Pheasant Coucals</strong> are sizeable black and brown birds. They are not particularly adept at flying, so prefer to run after their prey.</li>
<li><strong>Noisy Pittas</strong> are brightly coloured little rainforest birds.  They hop about in the undergrowth, and although quite common are not often seen.</li>
<li><strong>Long-tailed Nightjars</strong> are masters of disguise.  Their feathers are perfectly camouflaged amongst the leaf litter during the day while they sleep.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-5986" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-birds.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="313" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: left"></div>
<div></div>
<div>In addition to talking about birds, we also discussed the problems introduced species, such as foxes, can cause to fragile ecosystems.  Other introduced species to Australia include cane toads, rabbits, and (feral) cats.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This picture book is not only a wonderful read, but is rich with opportunities to discuss habitats, birdlife, camouflage, predators and more.  Great for low to mid primary, and any kids with an interest in wildlife.  (For my teacher friends, Scholastic provide <a href="http://www.scholastic.com.au/schools/education/teacherresources/assets/pdfs/Fox_and_Fine_Feathers.pdf">Teachers&#8217; Notes</a> on <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for classroom use.)</div>
<p><strong>Courtesy of Narelle Oliver herself, I have a SIGNED copy of <em>Fox and Fine Feathers</em> for one lucky SquiggleMum reader.  To enter, simply leave a comment below and tell me an Australian bird that your kids have seen in your area.  </strong>(It&#8217;s a great excuse to  look out for birds this week&#8230;)  One entry per person, Aussie residents only, comp closes Sun 18/3/12 8pm Qld time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-pitta2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-5987" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fox-fine-feathers-pitta2-298x300.jpg" alt="" width="298" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; If you adore Narelle&#8217;s work, prints from the book are available at the gorgeous <a href="http://www.marksandgardner.com/">Marks and Gardner</a> gallery online, or at their beautiful premises on Mt Tamborine.  Tell them SquiggleMum sent you <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></em></p>
<p>*I received a copy of the book from Narelle Oliver, but did not receive payment for this post.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To say the <em><strong>Octonauts</strong></em> have captured my kids&#8217; imaginations is an understatement, and I don&#8217;t think my children are alone!  I&#8217;ve overheard mums talking about the program, and kids role playing their favourite characters.  The Octonauts follows a team of adventure heroes who dive into action whenever there is trouble under the sea.  In  a fleet of aquatic vehicles they rescue amazing sea creatures, explore  incredible new underwater worlds and often save the day before returning  safely to their home base, the Octopod.<span id="more-5581"></span></p>

<p>So what is it exactly that makes this show stand out, and attract such a  wave of support from parents and children?  Here are 8 (hehehe&#8230;)  reasons why <em><strong>Octonauts </strong></em>are awesome:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong>.  This program is a visual feast.  The talented duo from <a href="http://www.meomi.com/">Meomi </a>create a stunning CGI underwater world which combines true aspects of aquatic life with imaginary elements.</li>
<li><strong>Soundtrack</strong>.  Composer Darren Hendley (who also wrote the music for <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/children/olivia/">Olivia</a>) brings to the program a high quality score reminiscent of any sci-fi-action-adventure film.  The music isn&#8217;t limited to opening and closing credits either. It features throughout each ten minute episode, adding to the excitement.</li>
<li><strong>Non-fiction content</strong>.  Each episode features an underwater animal in its natural habitat.  Along with the Octonauts, kids learn about interesting behaviours or unusual characteristics of each animal.</li>
<li><strong>Tried and true formula. </strong>Anyone who has watched their share of sci-fi adventures will recognise the similarities between the Octonauts and the crew from the Enterprise, or SG1, or&#8230;.  (Yes, I am married to a <a href="http://distractable.net">geek</a>).  Strong leader + shy medic + scientist-with-a-Scottish-accent + fearless adventurer = awesome team!</li>
<li><strong>Intelligent entertainment</strong>. Children&#8217;s programs which are &#8220;dumbed down&#8221; make me groan.  I believe television shows for kids should be language-rich, introduce interesting vocabulary, and model excellent use of conversation.  Octonauts more than meets my criteria in this department.</li>
<li><strong>Target age. </strong>There often seems to be a lack of good quality entertainment appropriate for kids in the 4-7 age range.  Between toddlers and tweenagers is a whole stage (which seems to be disappearing) called childhood!!  This program is ideal for lower primary aged kids. Yay!</li>
<li><strong>Environmental awareness</strong>.  I&#8217;m always happy for my kids to watch a television program which encourages them to get back outside after it&#8217;s finished, exploring the natural world and the creatures in it.  The &#8220;<em>Explore! Rescue! Protect!</em>&#8221; tagline of the Octonauts is relevant in any habitat.</li>
<li><strong>Understanding</strong>.  This program isn&#8217;t about good-guys and bad-guys.  It&#8217;s about good-guys and misunderstood-guys.  This is particularly important in the context of real animals.  There are no evil animals.  Sometimes creatures can harm us, but it is not because they are &#8220;bad&#8221; in any way.  Usually when animals hurt us it is because they are afraid and are defending themselves or their young.</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m sure I am not alone in grumbling through the daily chore of packing lunch boxes!  Usually I pack sandwiches, fresh fruit, crackers, dried fruit and a muesli bar.  To cut down the amount of plastic ziploc bags and clingwrap which end up in the rubbish, I instead use small containers, and these fantastic reusable bags from <a href="http://agoodwrap.com.au/">A Good Wrap</a>. (They also make the whole task a little more fun). <span id="more-5513"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/good-wrap-collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5521" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/good-wrap-collage.jpg" alt="" width="544" height="364" /></a></p>
<p>A Good Wrap products are made up of a 100% cotton exterior, and food safe zip lock nylon which can be easily wiped out.  They can also be washed in the sink with the daily dishes, or thrown into the washing machine.  Sandwiches and rolls stay fresh in the <a href="http://agoodwrap.com.au/products-page/thewrap/">wraps</a>, while the <a href="http://agoodwrap.com.au/products-page/smallbag/">small snack bags</a> and <a href="http://agoodwrap.com.au/products-page/mediumbag/">medium snack bags</a> are perfect for all the other bits that go into your child&#8217;s lunchbox.  The wraps and bags are secured with velcro.</p>
<p>Tiki Walsh, the Aussie mum-of-three behind <a href="http://agoodwrap.com.au/">A Good Wrap</a> says, &#8220;<em>We believe that locally produced food should be also wrapped in locally produced bags and wraps.   It&#8217;s better for our children and better for the environment.&#8221; </em>What a great philosophy.  Love it.  Oh, and check out the <a href="http://agoodwrap.com.au/fundraising/">fundraising ideas</a> as well.  I&#8217;m sure some schools and kindergartens would LOVE to have lunch wraps in their school colours or fabric!</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to Tiki, I have two prize packs valued at $36 each to give away.  Each pack contains a small snack bag, medium snack bag and sandwich wrap in a mix of fabrics. </strong>To enter, leave a comment below sharing a healthy lunchbox idea your child happily eats!  And if you could jump over and &#8220;like&#8221; <a href="http://www.facebook.com/agoodwrap">A Good Wrap&#8217;s facebook page</a> that would be great too.</p>
<p>Usual rules: one entry per person, Aussie residents only, comp closes Sat 10/9/11 8pm Qld time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_rainbow_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5427" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_rainbow_collage.jpg" alt="" width="496" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>My kids are huge fans of Justine Clarke, and I am a big supporter of her work as an Australian children&#8217;s entertainer.  I&#8217;ve met her <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/justine-clarke-in-concert/">backstage</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-interview-dvd-giveaway/">interviewed </a>her, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/justine-clarke-great-big-giveaway/">reviewed and given away</a> her albums and dvds&#8230; <strong>and now I am delighted to be able to give away tickets to her <em>Little Day Out</em> Tour!</strong> I have TWO double-passes for a couple of lucky SquiggleMum readers.<span id="more-5420"></span></p>
<p>In order to win a pair of tickets, simply share your favourite Justine song!  Do <span style="text-decoration: line-through">you</span> your kids have a favourite?  I couldn&#8217;t pick between my top 3 songs:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_colours.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-5428" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/justine_colours-281x300.jpg" alt="" width="281" height="300" /></a>Mrs Knife and Mr Fork</em> &#8211; One of my early faves.  For a children&#8217;s  song, the lyrics are just sublime.  Justine rocks a fifties vibe in the  film clip, and there&#8217;s lots of cool percussion played on cutlery.</li>
<li><em>Song to Make You Smile</em> &#8211; This song really does make me smile, and I sing it to the kids to make them smile too.  It has such a sweet melodic introduction, with a catchy chorus and positive message.</li>
<li><em>My Shadow and Me</em> &#8211; I loved this jazz number the first time I heard it, and I never tire of it.  Justine and her team really do set the standard when it comes to creating musically sophisticated, yet age appropriate for our kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>So over to you. Do you agree with my choices, or have a different favourite?<strong> Leave a comment sharing your favourite Justine Clarke song and you could win a double pass to the nearest venue (Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane)!</strong></p>
<p><em>One entry per person please, and you must be able to get to either the Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane show.  Two winners will be chosen at random.  Competition closes 8pm Qld time, Sunday 7/8/11.</em></p>
<p>Justine would love you to visit her <a href="http://www.facebook.com/JustineLikesToSing">facebook page</a>, or stop by her <a href="http://justineclarke.com.au/">website</a> for updates and info.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/holiday_earlymornings.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5308" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/holiday_earlymornings.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been hearing a message I really dislike:  <em>Keep your kids out of the winter weather</em>.  I&#8217;m not sure where the message is coming from, or why.  Of course we have to make allowances for weather, but there is no need to keep kids indoors.  Outdoor play is an important part of a child&#8217;s day &#8211; every day.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago to the day, I wrote here on the blog about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/playing-whatever-the-weather/">Playing Whatever the Weather</a>:</p>
<p><em>I don’t think we can expect children to tolerate extremes of temperature  they are not accustomed to, but I do think they should be able to enjoy  outside time in their home climate.  For my kids, temperatures range  from about 10 degrees celsius in winter, through to around 35 degrees in  summer.  Winter play means wearing lots of layers.  The  days start chilly, but do warm up and beanies need to be replaced with  sunhats.  Winter play doesn’t mean staying inside with the heater on.   Summer play means sunscreen, hats and sun-safe clothing.  It also means  drinking plenty of water, and playing out of the sun during the hottest  times.  Summer play doesn’t mean staying inside with the airconditioning  on!  Ok, yes there are days when I use the heater in winter, and the air  con in summer – but we don’t stay trapped inside and I always find the  kids have more fun outdoors.</em></p>
<p>A year on, I am nodding along to my own words. My opinion hasn&#8217;t changed.  I still think it&#8217;s important for kids to get outside, whatever the weather.  Next week the school holidays start, and I know it will be a great opportunity for my two munchkins to play together outside.  Here&#8217;s what a typical home day in the winter holidays looks like for us (with the morning routine relaxed because we&#8217;re not in a rush to get to school):</p>
<ul>
<li>6:30 &#8211; 7:30 Breakfast</li>
<li>7:30 &#8211; 8:30 Get dressed, brush teeth, make beds, do morning jobs</li>
<li>8:30 &#8211; 9:30 Play inside (or help Mum with housework)</li>
<li>9:30 &#8211; 10:30 Morning tea and <strong>outside free play</strong></li>
<li>10:30 &#8211; 12:00 Creative activity together, preferably <strong>outside </strong>(anything from painting to playing pirates!)</li>
<li>12:00 &#8211; 12:30 Lunch</li>
<li>12:30 &#8211; 1:30 Quiet Time in bedrooms (read or rest)</li>
<li>1:30 &#8211; 3:30 <strong>Outside free play</strong> or continuing activity and afternoon tea</li>
<li>3:30 &#8211; 4:00 Pack up sandpit, outside toys, creative mess</li>
<li>4:00 &#8211; 5:30 Play inside, TV on (while Mum gets dinner ready)</li>
<li>5:30 &#8211; 6:15 Dinner and bathtime</li>
<li>6:15 &#8211; 7:00 Stories and BED</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a pretty fluid schedule &#8211; times are just there to give you an idea. You can see though that the kids can easily have three or four hours outside during the warmest parts of the day.  I know that some days they will have extra time outdoors, because they&#8217;ll be keen to get outside straight after breakfast despite the chill, or because they&#8217;re still hunting for dinosaur eggs at 4:30 and haven&#8217;t noticed the temperature dropping!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind the tv going on in the late afternoons at all.  I know that the kids have had lots of outside time, and they&#8217;ve usually had enough of each other by then.  We&#8217;re all getting tired, crankiness creeps in, and I need to get dinner ready.  And what do I put on? <a href="http://www.madman.com.au/series/home/15601/dirtgirlworld">Dirtgirlworld </a>of course!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.madman.com.au/series/home/15601/dirtgirlworld">Dirtgirl </a>knows that winter is wonderful outside.  She loves winter&#8217;s nourishing soups, rugging up in lovely warm clothing and gumboots, and making the most of the sun when it&#8217;s out &#8211; even if it&#8217;s just for a little bit.  Me and Dirtgirl? We&#8217;re <em><strong>so </strong></em>on the same page.  Even when my kids are watching tv, they are getting the message that outside is where the fun is at.  Dirtgirl and Scrapboy give my kids ideas for tomorrow&#8217;s play, and encourage them to get their boots on and head outside all over again.</p>

<p><strong>Giggle and Hoot</strong> continue to go from strength to strength as the lovable co-hosts of <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/abcforkids/">ABC4Kids</a>.  I&#8217;ve had the opportunity both to <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/giggle-and-squiggle-giveaway/">interview Jimmy Giggle</a> (James Rees) and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/dear-jimmy-giggle/">meet him backstage</a>.  He really does deserve the attention he receives from kids across the country.  Late last year I watched him give the same genuine grin and hug to the 367th child waiting in line as he did for the first child in line.  He obviously loves what he does.</p>
<p>The latest offering from <strong>Giggle and Hoot</strong> is a DVD compilation of giggle-icious music.  Sing-along to new Giggle and Hoot   songs and enjoy well known tunes like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DitAAtfHYp8">Hoot&#8217;s Lullaby</a>.  On the DVD, <strong>Giggle and Hoot</strong> also present episodes or songs from some of my ABC favourites.  There&#8217;s a fantastic <strong>Playschool</strong> episode on Making Music, a <strong>Wiggle and Learn</strong> episode called &#8216;Beach, Beach, Sandy Beach,&#8217; songs from <strong>Justine Clarke</strong>, The <strong>Wiggles </strong>and more!  It&#8217;s a great compilation DVD for weekends, school holidays or rainy afternoons with toddlers!</p>
