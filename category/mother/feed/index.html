				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging as SquiggleMum in 2008, with an eight week old baby in my arms and a toddler under my feet. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but with two school aged kids and a busy life offline &#8211; I&#8217;m finally ready to let go of SquiggleMum. Well, the mum part anyway. <span id="more-6843"></span></p>
<p>I rarely write about parenting these days, and I feel that stories of my children&#8217;s adventures (or misadventures as the case may be) aren&#8217;t for me to share anymore. So I&#8217;m making a new home online, at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">squigglebooks.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglebooks.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6844" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/squigglebooks-logo1.png" alt="squigglebooks logo1" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">SquiggleBooks</a> you&#8217;ll find a mix of book reviews, posts about children&#8217;s literacy, thoughts about education, and tips for teachers. You&#8217;ll also be able to keep up with the latest news about my own writing career, and definitely be among the first to know <del>if</del> when I land that elusive picture book contract. It&#8217;s a pretty basic site for now, but I expect it will grow and change just as this blog has.</p>
<p>Before I go, I&#8217;d like to thank a bunch of people who have been part of the SquiggleMum journey. There have been thousands of comments on the blog over the years &#8211; <em>thank you</em> to each of you who took time to connect here. Some readers have become friends &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for staying in touch and encouraging me along the way. I have been privileged to write for a number of other parenting sites and share parenting advice on air &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for having me.  I have also won several awards and been invited to speak about blogging at conferences &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for the opportunity. Thank you to the bloggers who have been with me since the beginning &#8211; especially Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a>, as well as Kate from <a href="http://picklebums.com">Picklebums</a>, and Kelly from <a href="http://beafunmum.com/">Be A Fun Mum</a>. (There are too many others to name!)</p>
<p>I hope that many of you will join me in this next chapter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Blessings,</h2>
<h2>Cath / SquiggleMum.</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr5 starts full time school in just a few weeks, and he is <em><strong>so</strong></em> excited about wearing his new uniform and school shoes. We were recently treated to a complimentary pair of kids&#8217; shoes from <a href="http://www.bettskids.com.au/">Betts Kids</a>, so I took the opportunity to check out their <a href="http://www.bettskids.com.au/collection/?category=246&amp;erp_collection=1040">school shoe range</a>.<span id="more-6523"></span></p>
<p>Kids wear school shoes for about 1600 hours each year, so although I usually opt for cheap and cheerful when it comes to kids&#8217; shoes, I prefer to only buy one good quality pair of school shoes per year (if possible) and allow a budget of around $100.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/betts-girl-fitting.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6646 aligncenter" alt="betts girl fitting" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/betts-girl-fitting-682x1024.jpg" width="362" height="544" /></a></p>
<p>Here are my tips for school shoes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get in early. The longer you leave it, the longer the queue will be that you have to wait in. With kids.</li>
<li>Get school shoes professionally fitted. It doesn&#8217;t cost any extra.</li>
<li>Go for good quality leather. Leather breathes and lasts well. With regular polishing, scuff marks are easily taken care of. The old fashioned polish with a brush is much more effective than the roll on type.</li>
<li>Look for a sole with surrounding edge. Younger kids spend a lot of time sitting on the floor (and on concrete!) and the edge will protect the shoe from constant scraping.</li>
<li>Kids have to be able to get their own shoes on and off, so opt for velcro for little ones. Most schools allow velcro for at least the first two years of schooling. If your child is graduating to shoe laces, make sure they have had time to practise during the holidays.</li>
<li>Let them walk around the store in their new shoes. Or jump. Whatever. Let your child wear the new shoes in around the house in the week before school too.</li>
<li>Name them. &#8216;Nuff said.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/betts-jumping.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6648 aligncenter" alt="betts jumping" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/betts-jumping-651x1024.jpg" width="362" height="570" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Do you have any tips to add? </strong></p>
<p><em>Disclaimer: we received one pair of complimentary school shoes from Betts Kids. I did not receive any further payment for this post. </em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2014 feels like a new chapter for me. With both children at school full time, this year marks a new phase of life with lots of new beginnings.<span id="more-6620"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hello-New-Year.png"><img class="wp-image-6627 aligncenter" alt="Hello New Year" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Hello-New-Year.png" width="574" height="430" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>New Home.</strong>  The SOLD sign is up! We have purchased a house here in &#8220;The Shire&#8221; and are looking forward to putting our stamp on it. Sydney is our home now. <em>(Must buy new homewares.)</em></li>
<li><strong>New Job.  </strong>I am delighted to have been offered a part-time position working in Gifted and Talented Education. I will be working to extend students from a range of ages across various subject areas. <em>(Must buy new shoes.)</em></li>
<li><strong>New Study.</strong> Oh, and did I mention I&#8217;m going back to uni?! I am very excited about studying my Masters degree in Children&#8217;s Literature at Macquarie University, part time. <em>(Must buy new stationery.)</em></li>
</ol>
<p>I think all of that should keep me busy, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>I will still be blogging here, about mothering, teaching and writing. Five years ago when I began the blogging journey, I wrote largely about my own children and their early experiences. Now that they are older, I feel their stories are their own to share. I will still write about them occasionally (with their permission), but you will see more general educational posts, more book reviews, and perhaps even some more creative writing from me.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing 2014 with you. You can also stay in touch with me on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum">facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum">twitter</a> or <a href="http://pinterest.com/squigglemum">pinterest</a> if you&#8217;re interested. Happy New Year!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">This week I received a bittersweet letter from </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.compassion.com.au/index.php">Compassion Australia</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, letting us know that the child we have sponsored for many years no longer requires our financial support. She is now 15, and while we are so pleased her family in Indonesia is finally doing well financially, we are also sad as she has been an important part of our own family. Her photo has always been on the fridge alongside our own children&#8217;s school photos.<span id="more-6595"></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><iframe src="http://www.compassion.com.au/banner.php?intid=99&amp;strkey=97915ea0-66e6-11e3-b0a1-005056b06a0e" height="250" width="300" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>When we told the kids that we would be sponsoring a new child, we were surprised at their response. Both had instant and very strong feelings, and put forward their opinions without being asked. Mr 5 said, &#8220;Thailand. I think we should sponsor a child from Thailand Mummy. That is a poor country you know.&#8221; (How does he know anything about Thailand?!) Miss 7 said, &#8220;We really should choose a young child. If we sponsor a young child, we can have a big impact on their life Mum.&#8221; Wise words from someone still so young herself.</p>
<p><strong>So today I called Compassion. I found myself all choked up on the phone as I requested that we sponsor a young, needy child in Thailand. I don&#8217;t cry easily, and almost never in front of strangers, so it caught me a little off guard. </strong></p>
<p>I think my emotional reaction comes from the fact that God put the child we should sponsor onto the hearts of my own kids &#8211; and they were in tune with Him enough to listen. We sponsor because of the immeasurable impact it has on a child we will never meet, but the truth is that it has an impact on our children too.</p>
<p>We might not be rich by Sydney-standards, but we certainly are wealthy when compared to poverty stricken families. This Christmas, somewhere in Thailand is a three year old boy whose life will change, simply because we said yes to Compassion. And his mother probably has tears in her eyes too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://birdlife.org.au/">Bird Week</a>! I don&#8217;t really need an excuse to take my kids birdwatching because it&#8217;s my favourite weekend activity &#8211; but I realise it&#8217;s not a usual outing for most families. If you like the idea of birding but don&#8217;t really know how to tackle it with kids, here are some tips to help you out.<span id="more-6527"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6530" alt="kids birding squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg" width="613" height="408" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go at the right time</strong>. Birds are most active at sunrise and dusk. If your kids are early risers, make the most of it by heading out first thing. There are birds around at any time of day, but they are often less active during the middle of the day which can make it harder to see them.</li>
<li><strong>Pick the right place. </strong>Birds can be found everywhere &#8211; from backyard to beach to bush. However, if you pick your place carefully you will increase your chance of seeing a wider variety of species. I recommend finding a quiet, bushy spot near running water.</li>
<li><strong>Take the right gear</strong>. My kids love packing their own backpack. They take their own binoculars and/or camera, their hat, water bottle, and a snack. I usually also take an Australian bird identification book. (If you prefer something lighter, try a bird app. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/michael-morcombe-david-stewart/id397979505?mt=8">Morcombe &#8211; Stewart eGuide</a> is about the same price as the book but weighs a lot less! There is also a free lite version.)</li>
<li><strong>Wear the right clothing</strong>. Make sure your kids have sensible shoes and clothing for spending time outdoors. It&#8217;s a good idea to pre-apply insect repellant too, especially around ankles. Don&#8217;t forget hat and sunscreen.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the right weather</strong>. The birds won&#8217;t mind if the weather is miserable, but the kids will! Birding in the rain is only for hardcore bird nerds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow up activities for kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a picture of a bird you saw</li>
<li>Count how many birds you saw</li>
<li>Count how many species you saw</li>
<li>Print out a picture of a bird you photographed</li>
<li>Identify a bird you saw using the <a href="http://birdsinbackyards.net/finder">Birds in Backyards Bird Finder</a> or a bird book</li>
<li>Research a bird you saw and find out some interesting facts</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Have you ever been bird watching with your kids? Any other tips to share? </strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The word &#8220;home&#8221; has been on my mind a lot these past few weeks. What is home?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Home-wifi-squigglemum.png"><img class="wp-image-6468 aligncenter" alt="Home wifi squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Home-wifi-squigglemum-682x1024.png" width="434" height="653" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Home is a roof overhead</strong>. At least in the short term, <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/mums/hello-sydney/">&#8220;home&#8221; for us in Sydney</a> is a rental house. To be honest I feel unsettled living in a rented property. The house is lovely, and I am so grateful for it, but making it feel like it&#8217;s <em><strong>ours</strong></em> is challenging. <span id="more-6467"></span>No repainting feature walls, or hanging pictures where ever I like, and certainly no demolition of any kind! What I can do though is surround us with familiarity. I can put familiar faces on the fridge, I can put familiar cushions on the couch, and I can bake familiar things in the oven. (Actually, I haven&#8217;t quite worked out my oven here yet&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>Home is where ever we&#8217;re together</strong>. Cliched, I know. It&#8217;s funny how true it is though when you relocate a family. There are <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/activities/goodbye-brisbane/">things I miss about Brisbane</a>, but I&#8217;m not &#8220;homesick&#8221; because we&#8217;re here together. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">At the end of the day, it&#8217;s the togetherness that matters most. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">And the things that I do miss aren&#8217;t things anyway &#8211; they are people. I have wonderful friends in Brissy, and around the world, who will still be my friends no matter how far apart we are. A big move gives you a real perspective shift. </span></p>
<p><strong>Home is eternal</strong>. As a Christian, I also believe I have a forever-home in heaven and I need to remind myself that nothing here on earth is permanent. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">As I wrestle with the question of what home is, t</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">he unsettled feeling in my soul is probably good for me. My eyes should be fixed on something far greater than a nice house and a nice life. </span></p>
<p><strong>So what is home for you? Home is&#8230; </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>PS &#8211; while I&#8217;m on the topic of home, you might notice that my blog-home has been given a makeover too! It&#8217;s a cleaner, simpler design that is mobile friendly. Hope you like. Cath x</em></p>
