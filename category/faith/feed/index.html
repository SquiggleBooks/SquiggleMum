				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After church my six year old asked the question &#8211; &#8220;Mum, what does three in one mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>I took a deep breath before launching into my answer.  Despite the fact that I&#8217;ve been a Christian for most of my life, there are still some things I find hard to get my head around.  (There will probably always be things I can&#8217;t get my head around when it comes to God, because He&#8217;s God. And I&#8217;m not.)<span id="more-6102"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/three-rings.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6103" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/three-rings.jpg" alt="" width="368" height="358" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">So, as best I could I talked to her about God the Father, Jesus the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  The Bible is clear that they are all God, three in one.  My daughter looked confused (understandably), so I talked some more, using the example of three interconnected rings, or a three strand rope.  She still looked puzzled, and I feared I was confusing her more than helping her.  After all, it is a concept hard to fully grasp myself as an adult.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Instead of trying to give her the answers I thought she wanted, I asked if she had any questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8220;Mum,&#8221; she said.  &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t asking about God. I was just wondering about that coffee stuff in the kitchen&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nescafe-box.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6104" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/nescafe-box.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="194" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Note to self: </strong>don&#8217;t over think it!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">PS &#8211; this isn&#8217;t the Faith post I had planned for this month, but I had to share <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes I look like I&#8217;ve got life sorted.</p>
<p>But the truth is, most of the time, I&#8217;m not so together.<span id="more-6064"></span></p>
<p>The kids aren&#8217;t always happy. The bickies aren&#8217;t always home-baked. The floors aren&#8217;t always swept.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s highly likely I can&#8217;t find my keys, or my phone, or my shoes, or my brain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I know that God doesn&#8217;t need me to be perfect.</p>
<p>In fact &#8211; He often uses my weaknesses more than my strengths.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have talked a lot about life and death in our home over the last week.  It&#8217;s a heavy topic, but circumstances meant discussing death was unavoidable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6026" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/lily-black-bckgrnd-sq.jpg" alt="" width="449" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The first thing that happened was that a young mum from our church passed away.  The kids understandably had some questions&#8230;<span id="more-5996"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mummy why are you sad?</li>
<li>What is a funeral?</li>
<li>What happens when people die?</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>I&#8217;m crying because a very sad thing happened -everybody cries sometimes.  A funeral is like a special church service where thank God for someone&#8217;s life, and celebrate what was wonderful about them even though we are sad.  And I believe that when we die, those who have accepted Jesus live forever with Him. </em></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6022" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/gouldian-eggs-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The second thing that happened was that two of our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finch-love/">Gouldian Finch</a> eggs hatched.  The pair had been sitting on four tiny eggs.  Unfortunately a common behaviour of Gouldians is to &#8220;pitch&#8221; their young.  For a range of reasons, the parents toss their own chicks out of the nest.  Sadly our finches pitched their two chicks, and despite our attempts to return them to the nest, we were unable to save them.  The other two eggs did not hatch.  Again, the kids had questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why did they throw their babies?</li>
<li>Why didn&#8217;t the other eggs hatch?</li>
<li>Should we bury them?</li>
<li>Why is nature so unfair?</li>
<li>Why do some creatures live and some die?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It is unfair, isn&#8217;t it? Sometimes Gouldians pitch their young because the chicks aren&#8217;t healthy, and sometimes because they just aren&#8217;t ready to be parents yet.  (Aren&#8217;t you glad I&#8217;m not a Mummy Finch?! I would never pitch you.)  I don&#8217;t know why the other two eggs didn&#8217;t hatch. Perhaps they didn&#8217;t grow properly inside, or maybe the parents didn&#8217;t keep them warm enough.  It&#8217;s hard to understand, but it&#8217;s important to remember that everything that lives &#8211; dies one day.  Yes, we can bury them together.  Let&#8217;s dig a little hole&#8230; </em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6029" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/hot-cross-bun-sq.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>And thirdly, this weekend is Easter.  Today is Good Friday, the day we reflect on Jesus&#8217; death on the cross.  Sunday is coming, the day we celebrate His resurrection.  And the kids have questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why isn&#8217;t it called Bad Friday?</li>
<li>Why did Jesus die?</li>
<li>When can we have Easter eggs?!</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>I don&#8217;t have all the answers to questions about life and death, but I answered the kids to the best of my ability, at an age appropriate level, according to what I believe.  </strong><em>It does seem like a funny name because bad stuff happened and it was really sad when Jesus died on the cross.  But we call it Good Friday because it was good that Jesus came, good that He did all the things God sent Him to do, and good because the job was finished on the cross.  Jesus died for us so that we can all have new life.  Today we eat hot cross buns to remind us of the cross, and on Sunday, we&#8217;ll eat Easter eggs because eggs remind us of new life!</em></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center"><strong><em>(image: <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/theoldpostroad">The Old Post Road</a> etsy store) </em></strong></div>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Jeremiah-29-11-art.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5967" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Jeremiah-29-11-art.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="323" /></a></em></strong></p>
<p>Jeremiah 29:11 is a well known and much loved Bible verse, and it&#8217;s been on my heart this week.  You see, all of <em>my plans</em> have gone out the window, and God&#8217;s plan has fallen into place in a remarkable way.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">When things go right, some people say that &#8220;the planets have aligned.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Others say things are an &#8220;amazing coincidence&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I say it&#8217;s God.<span id="more-5964"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5966 aligncenter" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/jer2911subway-240x300.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="300" /></p>

<p>In a couple of weeks I will be returning the work force in a part-time capacity.  I wasn&#8217;t actively looking for a job. The job found me, and the process has been incredibly smooth.  It&#8217;s a <em>great</em> job working with families and picture books (two of my favourite things).  I&#8217;m delighted to be able to promote the importance of reading in the early years throughout the community.  I&#8217;ll fill you in on more of the job details soon.</p>
<p>The thing is, this wasn&#8217;t my plan. <em>My plan</em> was to do a bit of supply teaching, or return to the classroom in a year or two when my youngest reaches school age too.  I like making my own plans. I like to feel in control.  But if I&#8217;d stuck with <em>my plan</em>, I would have missed this wonderful opportunity!</p>
<p><em>His plan</em> fills me with hope for the future.  <em>His plan</em> is good.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This post is part of the monthly <a href="http://squigglemum.com/faith/introducing-growing-in-god/">Growing In God</a> series. <a href="http://squigglemum.com/faith/introducing-growing-in-god/">Join us</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/squigglemum-backyard-rain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5891" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/squigglemum-backyard-rain.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><strong>&#8220;Mummy, my prayer didn&#8217;t work.&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p>My five year old was both cross and confused.  She had asked God for the rain to stop so that she and her friends could play in the big playground at school (a new novelty for the Grade One kids), but the wet weather persisted.  If anything, the rain got heavier as the week went on!<span id="more-5889"></span></p>
<p>It was a teachable moment &#8211; a perfect opportunity to talk about prayer.  With kids I often use the phrase, &#8220;Let&#8217;s talk to God&#8221; instead of &#8220;Let&#8217;s pray&#8221; because it puts prayer in a context they can understand.  Prayer is a conversation with God.  And conversations don&#8217;t usually go well when one person tells the other what they want, and then gets cranky when things don&#8217;t go their way!</p>
<p>In words she could understand, I explained to my daughter that prayer isn&#8217;t a magic button you can push to guarantee an outcome you desire.  Sure, you can talk to God about anything you like.  I believe He hears.  I believe He can, and <em>does</em> answer prayers.  But sometimes when we ask God for something His answer is no, or not yet.  That&#8217;s the hard bit.  Sometimes we pray about really big, really important things &#8211; and God still says no, or not yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *   *   *</p>
<p>I have to admit that there&#8217;s a challenge there for me too.  Too often I pray like a child, asking for what I want and only seeing things from my own narrow perspective.  Too often I&#8217;m the one who treats prayer as a magic button.  Too often I forget that prayer is a conversation, which requires me to listen and not just talk!</p>
<p>I love sharing my faith with the kids. It&#8217;s a privilege, but it&#8217;s also a responsibility.  The challenge is to keep maturing in my own faith.  I don&#8217;t have to have all the answers, but I do need to continue growing in God.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances&#8230; </strong>(1 Thess 5:16-18)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the Christmas break our little family enjoyed a week away at Coffs Harbour.  The kids and I particularly enjoyed the time we spent on the beach together (while SquiggleDad was sleeping in!)  We collected shells and pebbles, built sandcastles, explored the rocks, watched birds, and chased waves.  I grabbed a &#8220;teachable moment&#8221; to spontaneously talk to the kids about God too&#8230;<span id="more-5783"></span></p>

<p>I&#8217;m so excited to introduce you to a new project for this year: <em><strong>Growing in God</strong></em>.</p>
<p>For quite some time now I have wanted to post more about my life as a Christian mum.  Over the last few years I have been writing more for Christian women&#8217;s publications such as <em>Footprints Magazine</em>, <em>Mum2Mum</em> Magazine, MOPS Australia&#8217;s blog, as well as editing <em>Better Mum </em>Magazine &#8211; but I have shared less about my faith here on my own blog.<span id="more-5769"></span></p>
<p>This year, on the 1st of each month, I will share a <em><strong>Growing in God</strong></em> post here at SquiggleMum.  It could be about raising kids in a Christian family, about a child&#8217;s growing faith, about my life as a Christian woman and mother, or just about the way I too am continuing to grow in God.  Sometimes I might simply share an encouraging verse, image or even song.</p>
<p>Would you like to join me?  I would love you to share a faith post at the start of each month on your own blog, in your own style.  You are welcome to use the <em><strong>Growing in God</strong></em> image in your sidebar, or on any particular posts.  There is no need to link to my blog unless you wish to.  If you would like other Christian mums to visit your <em><strong>Growing in God</strong></em> post, just leave a comment on my posts each month.  (I&#8217;m happy to set up a linky if you&#8217;d all prefer.)  <strong>I would love you to join me in this project, and I am looking forward to reading what you have to share!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>My kids are a work in progress.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>I am a work in progress too.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Our family is&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/growing-in-god-125px-2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5774" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/growing-in-god-125px-2.png" alt="" width="125" height="125" /></a></p>

<p>It&#8217;s the first day of the new year.  Wow, 2011.  Today we have been packing away the tree and all the Christmasy things we&#8217;ve been using throughout December.</p>
<p>Every year I use an old recipe passed down through my husband&#8217;s family to bake Christmas bickies.  As I returned the  Christmas shaped cutters to the back of the baking drawer I noticed that some of them were bent out of shape.  I squeezed the sides of the metal carefully, pushing them back into place.  (Undoubtedly the result of the kids &#8220;helping&#8221; with the baking!)  As I fiddled with the heart shaped cutter, evening up the two sides and getting it to look right again, I couldn&#8217;t help but draw the obvious metaphor.</p>
<p>Did your heart get bent out of shape over Christmas, or during the past year?  What do you need to do to get it balanced up again at the start of this new year?  Do you need to forgive someone?  Let go of a hurt?  Or perhaps you just need to take some time to look after yourself?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not big on new year&#8217;s resolutions, but I am big on a making fresh start each year.  If you ask me, getting your heart right is guaranteed to help you start the year afresh.</p>
