		<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-694" title="566616_75622404" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/566616_75622404-300x225.jpg" alt="566616_75622404" width="300" height="225" />I made a great dinner last night.   Lovely grilled ocean trout with wilted greens and a lime soy dressing served on a bed of rice.   Masterchef eat your heart out.   (Even my three year old scraped her plate clean!)   After enjoying our meal, my hubby and I put the kids to bed and cleaned up.   As usual I just tossed out the leftover rice because there wasn&#8217;t enough for another meal, and in all honesty I couldn&#8217;t be bothered coming up with something creative to do with the amount left.   I thought nothing of it and started opening the mail.   The first letter was from <a href="http://compassion.com.au">Compassion</a>, and it just about smacked me across the face.</p>
<p>It should have been a feel-good letter.  It was thanking us for a recent donation to assist with the current global food crisis.  But I didn&#8217;t feel good.  I felt guilty.  The letter opened with a quote from a mother in Nicaragua who said, &#8220;<em>Many blessings have come in moments when we most needed it, like someone showing up with rice&#8230;&#8221;</em> Yep, rice.  And I had just chucked our leftover rice out because I was lazy.</p>
<p>Right at that moment the world seemed horribly wrong to me.  How is it that one mother considers a cup of rice an answer to prayer, while another tosses it into the rubbish?  How is it that one family earns so little that they can&#8217;t feed their children a single simple meal, while another earns so much that they eat five times a day, every day?</p>
<p>Making the donation didn&#8217;t impact me, but the stark contrast between the way two mothers view rice did.  I was glad that I felt bad, if you know what I mean.  That unsettled, uncomfortable feeling is what makes us take action.  God trusted us with this world and I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;ve done such a good job with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certain that the next time I cook rice for my family I&#8217;ll be thinking about that mum in Nicaragua.  I&#8217;ll talk to my daughter about the child we sponsor through Compassion, and about the way we can change the world one child at a time.  And when we say grace, we&#8217;ll pray for the kids with no rice and with empty tummies.  Maybe if we show our kids what&#8217;s wrong with the world, they&#8217;ll do a better job than we have of making things right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">___________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Do you sponsor a child?  If not, check out <a href="http://www.compassion.com.au/child_list.asp">Compassion </a>or <a href="http://trans.worldvision.com.au/ChildSponsorship/ChildSearch.aspx">World Vision</a> and change the world for one child</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-674" title="img_6229" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_6229-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6229" width="300" height="225" />I love this photo of my son and I blogging.   Well, I&#8217;m blogging and he&#8217;s giving me material to write about!   As children of a software developer and a reasonably tech-savvy mama, my kids are bound to be fairly technically literate and exposed to the online world from a young age.   But how young is too young?   Or is there no such thing, given that these kids are growing up as &#8220;digital natives&#8221;?</p>
<p>My son is 8mths old.   A laptop is certainly not a foreign item to him.   He knows that we touch the keys, but not the screen.   He knows that we use gentle fingers on the keys and do not hit them!   He is allowed to play with an old keyboard, but knows Mummy&#8217;s laptop is <em>not</em> for touching.</p>
<p>My daughter has just turned 3.   She regularly emails family and friends, with help from me.   She independently types her name and inserts smileys (shift key and all) and knows how to change the size and colour of the font in her text.  She knows what Google is.   She knows my online name is SquiggleMum (and has asked her father if he is &#8220;SquiggleDaddy&#8221;).   She knows what a blog is.   She knows how to get out of a program she has inadvertently opened by pressing esc.   She knows how to insert a CD and plug in a USB mouse.   She knows we use computers to find information, to communicate with people, to share photos, to watch video and to listen to music.  I didn&#8217;t know most of these things until I was well into my teens!</p>
<p>I want my kids to be able to function effectively in the world they find themselves growing up in &#8211; but as their Mum I also want to protect them.  I want to expose them to new technologies without exposing them to danger.  And that means I need to make some decisions, sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Will I let them have their own email addresses?  Will I let them post to their own blog?  Will I let them claim their own Twitter profile?  E-literate parents are already gently leading their little ones into the blogosphere, or the twitterverse, or whatever you want to call it.  A prominent Aussie blogger&#8217;s son, for example, has his own Twitter profile and almost two hundred followers.  He&#8217;s two and a half years old.  Too  young?  Maybe, maybe not.  He might have a significant following, but the only person he follows online is his Daddy.  Obviously his dad is watching out for him.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&#8217;m happy with my kids sending and receiving emails via my address, having their faces and stories (selectively chosen) on my blog, and not having a presence on Twitter or Facebook.  I guess I&#8217;ll have to keep reviewing that though.  Technologies change rapidly and children grow fast!  What have you decided about the amount you will expose your kids to the online world?  I&#8217;d love you to share your opinion &#8211; but please do it sensitively as we are talking about real people&#8217;s kids.</p>

<p>My daughter always seems ready to embrace the next stage in life long before I am.  She was on the go before I was ready for her to crawl.  She was walking before I had good shoes for her little feet.  She climbed out of the cot before we had bought a single bed for her to move to.  You get the idea.  Today my little munchkin turned three.  She&#8217;s ready.  I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Three is the end of being a toddler.  I just got used to saying I have a baby and a toddler.  What do I have now?  She&#8217;s not a kid yet.  She&#8217;s still little.  Three is still little!  She still needs help with a knife and fork.  She still needs help climbing out of the bathtub.  She still needs someone to do up her buttons, brush her teeth and tie her pigtails.  She&#8217;s still little!!!</p>
<p>I guess if she&#8217;s ok with being somewhere between a toddler and a kid, I should be ok with that too.  Really it&#8217;s a special time, because she&#8217;s <em>just</em> big enough to be independent, and <em>just </em>little enough to still need her Mummy.  And I have a feeling this phase won&#8217;t last long.   I only have the rest of this year with her at home before she&#8217;ll be off to kindy!</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to Little Miss Three: my big little Mummy&#8217;s girl.  There&#8217;s a part of me that hopes she never completely grows up.</p>

		<p><em>My daughter turns three tomorrow, so I&#8217;m spending today doing the cake and getting things ready.  Thought I might <a href="http://www.scarymommy.com/flashback-friday-facebook-friends/">flashback</a> to this article I wrote in 2008 after her second birthday party.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-644" title="img_4332" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_4332-300x225.jpg" alt="img_4332" width="300" height="225" />Before becoming a mother I spent many years as a teacher.<span> </span>I planned excursions and celebrations and full scale musical productions.<span> </span>So I had no qualms about planning a little party for a two year old.<span> </span></p>
<p>I was quite pleased with my preparations.<span> </span>Low stress venue?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Age appropriate games?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Healthy but appetising morning tea?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Party bags that parents would be as pleased to receive as their children?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>The only thing I was slightly concerned about was the cake.</p>
<p>When I was growing up my mother had one of those Women’s Weekly cake books that everyone’s mum seemed to have.<span> </span>For a good two weeks leading up to a birthday my sister and I would pore over every picture as we tried to decide which cake would become the celebration’s centrepiece.<span> </span>A marshmallow Dolly Varden cake?<span> </span>Or a maypole cake with colourful ribbons and miniature dancing girls?<span> </span></p>
<p>With such fond childhood memories I looked forward to preparing a gorgeous butterfly cake for my own daughter’s birthday.<span> </span>That is, until the day before the party, when the realisation actually hit me.<span> </span>I think I had mistakenly come to the conclusion that cake decorating was a skill you automatically received during childbirth!<span> </span>You know, just one of those “mum things” that every mother is inherently capable of.<span> </span></p>
<p>I was starting to panic just a little when my sister rang to see how the party preparations were going.<span> </span>I told her nonchalantly that I only had the cake left to organise.<span> </span>My sister, who is far more competent in the kitchen than I am, cut straight through my pretence with a simple question.<span> </span>“What kind of icing are you using?” she asked.<span> </span>“You mean there’s more than one kind?!” I asked in return.<span> </span>As she laughed I said that sentence that I should say more often, even if it makes me cringe.<span> </span>“I think I need some help.”</p>
<p>My sister came over with creative ideas and beautiful cookbooks.<span> </span>(I noticed none of her books had bent pages or spilt ingredients on them but she doesn’t have children – yet.)<span> </span>Together we decided on a simple design, a basic icing, and a decorating plan of attack.<span> </span>Then she left me to it.<span> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_649" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-649" title="img_4451" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_4451-300x225.jpg" alt="img_4451" width="210" height="158" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Flitter Flutter</p></div>
<p>That cake was a labour of love for me.<span> </span>And it turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself.<span> </span>It took pride of place in the middle of the table, but in all honesty it wasn’t the centrepiece of the celebration.<span> </span>My daughter was.<span> </span>She looked like a little fairy princess, and her smile told me that she felt like one too.<span> </span>I realised almost too late that she wasn’t impressed by my organisational skills or culinary efforts.<span> </span>She was just so happy to be with her little friends, to have two candles to blow out, and to have her mummy fluttering around in a pair of wings just like her!<span> </span>Everything else was just, well, icing on the cake…</p>

<p>Firstly, colouring the salt.  I bought a decent sized bag of no-name salt (for the grand sum of about 99c I think).  We poured some salt into a bowl, added a few drops of food colouring and stirred until the salt was evenly coloured.  Then we spread it out on a plate and nuked it for a minute or two in the microwave.  We put the salt aside to cool for a few minutes before transferring it to a craft container, and we repeated the process to make three different coloured batches.</p>
<p>On to creating!  This was an activity we mostly did together.  I drew simple outline shapes (butterflies, flowers, fish, etc) on paper with a dark marker.  We filled in sections of the picture with glue, then sprinkled on spoonfuls of salt.  We used one colour at a time and tipped the excess salt back into its container.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-634" title="img_6412" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_6412-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6412" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>As my daughter got the hang of it she was able to do more of this craft on her own.  Her favourite part of the activity was seeing where the salt had stuck to the glue as we tipped off the excess.  We really enjoyed this activity together &#8211; and there wasn&#8217;t <em>that </em>much mess to clean up!</p>
<p>Have you tried this activity before?  Any tips to share&#8230;?</p>

		<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-624" title="rebecca_may" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/rebecca_may.jpg" alt="rebecca_may" width="242" height="346" />Meet the inspirational Rebecca Mason &#8211; <span>a wife, mother of 6 children (aged 6 wks to 10 yrs) and midwife living on the outskirts of Melbourne who has a passion for travelling and has a vision to inspire large families.  She is the founder of the <a href="http://www.familyvalue.com.au">Family Value </a>website which lists Aussie family attractions encourages them to bring back ‘Family Entry at Family Prices’.  Here are her five faves:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>1.  Favourite outing with kids</strong> &#8211; </span>Our favourite family outing is a trip to <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/">Melbourne Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.melbourneaquarium.com.au/">Melbourne Aquarium</a> &amp; <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/Scienceworks/">Scienceworks</a>.  All 3 attractions are excellent value, particularly the Museum with children gaining free entry.  Annual family memberships make for excellent family value.  All 3 attractions are also excellent for all ages and a full ‘relaxing’ day could easily be spent.  Apart from these attractions we love to take advantage of the free City of Melbourne seasonal events such as Moomba, the unveiling of the Christmas Advent Calendar &amp;  Myer Christmas Windows, as well as holiday activities.  We love these!  We also recently had an awesome time at the <a href="http://www.bendigoeasterfestival.org.au/">Annual Easter Festival</a> in Bendigo where most of the attractions were free and rides were only $2.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with kids</strong> &#8211; Making things!  At our house we  love to create!  We have many ‘making books’ in the bookshelf and often have instant access to the internet where we can surf the web for creative projects to satisfy the moment!  From painting, drawing, making machines (with Dad), face painting, creating for future birthday parties (such as piñatas), and baking cakes &amp; muffins we attempt them all!  The odd performance concert is also a favourite with piano, clarinet, saxophone, recorders, dancing, music, acrobatics &amp; comedy sketches all a feature.  The concerts are recommended for ‘passing time’ for the children, however, I would recommend the audience has been ‘prepped’ with a cup of coffee (or 2 or 3!!).</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal</strong> &#8211; Definitely ‘Flat Things’ or known to the rest of the world as Fajita Wraps.  We love ‘Flat Things’ because every member of the family can choose their own filling and it&#8217;s kind of healthy at the same time (depending on the fillings).  Not to mention it is the easiest meal to prepare!</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories</strong> &#8211; This changes from day to day, however, we do read bedtime stories every evening.  At the moment, <em>Happy Birth Day</em> and <em>Hi New Baby</em> (Robie H. Harris) are favourites with the younger kids and the older children are enjoying having <em>Superfudge</em> (Judy Blume) read to them every evening.  My kids can relate to these books as they are currently adjusting to a new baby in the house.  Our little one is only 6 weeks old!</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down</strong>! &#8211; On the lounge with hubby in front of the TV with ‘secret takeaway’ from our local Greek Restaurant when the kids are in bed.  Of course funds don’t allow for the takeaway every evening so this is usually a fortnightly indulgence.  Surfing the web and lying down with a good book are also a treat!</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-614" title="img_5511" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_5511-225x300.jpg" alt="img_5511" width="225" height="300" />It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day!  A day to celebrate motherhood.  A day to recognise the sacrifices women make in order to become mums.  A day to think about your mother.  A day to reflect on how your own kids came into the world.   A day to acknowledge that they have <em>changed </em>you.</p>
<p>Since becoming a mum, some changes have been harder to embrace than others.  My figure has changed &#8211; that gets me down sometimes.  My income has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s strange to work so hard at a job for zero pay!  My grocery list has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s now twice as long and includes milk that comes in 3L bottles.  My mornings have changed &#8211; anything past 7am now qualifies as a sleep in.  I could go on, but I know that focusing on the tough aspects of mothering doesn&#8217;t serve much of a useful purpose.  I might get a laugh out of it, but really it only makes me begrudge a choice I willingly and joyfully made.  I wanted to be a mum!  So this Mother&#8217;s Day, I&#8217;m going to focus on how my kids have changed me&#8230; for the better.</p>
<p>1.  My name has changed.  They call me Mummy and I love it.  (Ok, so my baby boy has only just started trying out a sound that vaguely resmembles mumumum&#8230;. but I&#8217;m counting it.)</p>
<p>2.  I&#8217;m more <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/waiting-game/">patient</a>.  If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog for a while you&#8217;ll know that this isn&#8217;t one of my strong suits.  My kids are constantly helping me in this area!</p>
<p>3. I appreciate me-time so much more.  Before becoming a mum I took this for granted.  I didn&#8217;t know what it meant to treasure time to myself, or time with a girlfriend, or time with my husband.</p>
<p>4. I&#8217;m less judgmental.    Oh how I&#8217;d love to take back some of the things I thought about other mothers, before I actually became one myself!</p>
<p>5.  My heart has changed.  I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happened.  It&#8217;s grown more sections or something.  I feel things I couldn&#8217;t feel before.  Sometimes my heart wants to break for my kids, and sometimes it wants to burst!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure all of these changes are permanent, and I&#8217;m glad.  I know my heart will never be the same again, and I hope that I keep growing in patience and working on my judgmental streak.  And one day, when I&#8217;m just &#8220;Mum&#8221; and not &#8220;Mummy&#8221; anymore, I hope I remember how it felt to have them look up at me and say my name.</p>
<p>How has becoming a mum changed you&#8230; for the better?</p>

<p>We took a trip to a nursery together and found Australian Native Violets (Viola hederacea) for only a couple of dollars.  A plant like this is perfect for planting with kids.  It&#8217;s small, has cute flowers, is easy to grow, spreads as a groundcover, and is happy in a pot or in the garden.  We chose to put ours in a pot on the front verandah.  My toddler was able to fill the pot with potting mix, tease the roots gently, put the plant in the hole, fill the dirt back in around it, and add pretty rocks.  She has diligently watered her violets every (yup, <strong>every</strong>) day since planting them, and they are absolutely thriving!</p>
<p>My children really are city kids, so I feel like these kinds of activities are especially important.  I want them to still understand about how things grow.  They need to know where flowers and fruits and vegetables come from.  I know they&#8217;ll learn about the parts of a plant and requirements for growth when they get to school, but I can teach them something else.  I can show them what it means to nurture something &#8211; to lovingly tend to it and care for it, and to take pride in the growth that results.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">________________________________________________</p>
<p>The Secret Garden (Frances Hodgson Burnett, (c) 1911) is one of my favourite books of all time.  Since I stole the title of this blog post from the book, I thought I&#8217;d share these snippets from Chapter XII:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Is there anything you want?&#8230; Do you want toys, books, dolls?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Might I,” quavered Mary, “might I have a bit of earth?”</em></p>
<p><em>In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound and that they were not the ones she had meant to say.   Mr. Craven looked quite startled.</em></p>
<p><em>“Earth!” he repeated.  “What do you mean?”</em></p>
<p><em>“To plant seeds in–to make things grow–to see them come alive,” Mary faltered.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room. “You can have as much earth as you want,” he said. &#8220;You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and things that grow.  When you see a bit of earth you want,&#8221; with something like a smile, “take it, child, and make it come alive.”</em></p>

<p>I am currently typing this article on my brand new shiny purple laptop because I had to sell my yellow car. Don’t quite follow? Read on&#8230;</p>
<p>It all came about because we are expecting our second child very soon. I always knew that my zippy little yellow hatchback wouldn’t cut it with two kids, and that I would eventually inherit my husband’s very sensible, very safe and practical silver sedan. I just didn’t expect to be so upset about the transition.</p>
<p>I don’t cry easily, even pregnant. So I caught my husband (and perhaps even myself) a little off guard when I cried a fountain of tears over saying goodbye to my little yellow car. It wasn’t that I desperately loved the vehicle. It was more that I loved what it represented. It was one of the last reminders of the girl I was in my pre-mum days. That car was a little piece of me on the road. Joyful, carefree, bold, with heaps of get-up-and-go. It was easy to drive and a dream to park. In my little fun-buggy I could go anywhere, do anything, and be completely independent. I felt like I was farewelling a part of myself as I farewelled my yellow car.</p>
<p>It seemed I had gone from having a colour-filled life to a life of grey. I cried my heart out and said to my husband, “I have your hand-me-down car, your hand-me-down computer and your mobile phone! There’s nothing left of ME anymore.” To his credit, my hubby was incredibly understanding. In fact he was the one who suggested the new laptop. Somehow he understood my need to retain a sense of self.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong – I love being a mum. It’s just that it’s important to me to remember who I am aside from being a mother. I will only be “Mummy” for a season. When my children one day grow up, and leave home, I don’t want to wonder who I am! So I need to keep some things in my life that remind me of who God created me to be. Joyful, carefree, bold, with heaps of get-up-and-go. Hence the shiny, purple laptop.</p>
<p>I use my computer daily. It’s my primary writing tool, my letter box, my 24hr help line and my link to the outside world. And I smile every time I use it because it’s so ME.</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-578" title="Imaginary Mice" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_5369-225x300.jpg" alt="Imaginary Mice" width="225" height="300" />I love to see children being creative and using their imaginations, but I&#8217;m seriously starting to worry about my daughter.  Her imagination is out of control!  I&#8217;ve heard of kids having an imaginary friend before, but this is ridiculous.  My toddler has a whole imaginary menagerie!</p>
<p>It started with a family of mice &#8211; completely out of the blue.  We hadn&#8217;t read any books about a mice, or seen anything on tv about mice or even talked about mice recently.  So where they came from, I have no idea.  From the moment they first &#8220;appeared&#8221; they were very tangible to my daughter.  She told me that there was a mummy mouse, daddy mouse, a girl mouse and a boy mouse (just like our family).  She told me what they were doing, where they were going, and how they were acting.  They scurried up her leg and travelled around on her shoulder.  They went to MOPS with us and to the shops with us.  She even asked the minister at church to hold them for her while she was busy doing a job!  (He very kindly went along with the whole debacle.)</p>
<p>I could probably deal with it if it stopped with the mice.  But oh no!  She now has imaginary animals all over the house.  If you&#8217;re not careful you might sit on pretend eggs from the pretend chooks.  And there are always &#8220;chocolate butterflies&#8221; flying around in our loungeroom.  If you are quick as one flits past, you can just pluck it out of the sky and gobble it up.  Quite the delicacy.  Are you starting to see why I might be concerned?!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve posted about my <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/playing-pretend/">daughter&#8217;s imagination</a>, and it probably won&#8217;t be the last.  I&#8217;d love some feedback from other mums/moms.  Anyone else had experience with their kids having imaginary friends (or imaginary animals)?  Anyone like to comment on whether this is &#8220;normal&#8221; for an almost three-year-old, or a little quirky?  Should I stop worrying and just enjoy this phase while it lasts?!  Please leave me a comment.</p>
