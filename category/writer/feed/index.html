				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging as SquiggleMum in 2008, with an eight week old baby in my arms and a toddler under my feet. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but with two school aged kids and a busy life offline &#8211; I&#8217;m finally ready to let go of SquiggleMum. Well, the mum part anyway. <span id="more-6843"></span></p>
<p>I rarely write about parenting these days, and I feel that stories of my children&#8217;s adventures (or misadventures as the case may be) aren&#8217;t for me to share anymore. So I&#8217;m making a new home online, at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">squigglebooks.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglebooks.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6844" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/squigglebooks-logo1.png" alt="squigglebooks logo1" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">SquiggleBooks</a> you&#8217;ll find a mix of book reviews, posts about children&#8217;s literacy, thoughts about education, and tips for teachers. You&#8217;ll also be able to keep up with the latest news about my own writing career, and definitely be among the first to know <del>if</del> when I land that elusive picture book contract. It&#8217;s a pretty basic site for now, but I expect it will grow and change just as this blog has.</p>
<p>Before I go, I&#8217;d like to thank a bunch of people who have been part of the SquiggleMum journey. There have been thousands of comments on the blog over the years &#8211; <em>thank you</em> to each of you who took time to connect here. Some readers have become friends &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for staying in touch and encouraging me along the way. I have been privileged to write for a number of other parenting sites and share parenting advice on air &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for having me.  I have also won several awards and been invited to speak about blogging at conferences &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for the opportunity. Thank you to the bloggers who have been with me since the beginning &#8211; especially Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a>, as well as Kate from <a href="http://picklebums.com">Picklebums</a>, and Kelly from <a href="http://beafunmum.com/">Be A Fun Mum</a>. (There are too many others to name!)</p>
<p>I hope that many of you will join me in this next chapter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Blessings,</h2>
<h2>Cath / SquiggleMum.</h2>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few new releases have crossed my desk in the lead up to Christmas, and few others I have heard about from colleagues. Here is a quick round up of what&#8217;s new on the shelves, and who these picture books might be suitable for as a gift this Christmas&#8230;<span id="more-6829"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/count-my-christmas-kisses.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6831 size-medium" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/count-my-christmas-kisses-298x300.jpg" alt="count-my-christmas-kisses" width="298" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;One kiss for baby, under mistletoe. Two kisses for baby, catching falling snow&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Count My Christmas Kisses</p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: Harper Collins / ABC Books</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: Ruthie May</p>
<p><strong>Illustrator</strong>: Tamsin Ainslie</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: A sweet, simple counting book perfect for baby&#8217;s first Christmas. It&#8217;s unfortunately very European for an Australian picture book (no snow here!) but it is delightful nonetheless. Recommended for Under 2s, and for young children who have welcomed a baby sibling this year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mr-Darcy-Pudding.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6832 size-medium" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mr-Darcy-Pudding-300x295.png" alt="Mr Darcy Pudding" width="300" height="295" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;With the fire crackling in the background, they all helped with the mixture for Mr Darcy&#8217;s famous Christmas pudding&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: Mr Darcy and the Christmas Pudding</p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: New Frontier</p>
<p><strong>Author</strong>: Alex Field</p>
<p><strong>Illustrator</strong>: Peter Carnavas</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: Alex Field has previously released two other Mr Darcy books, also illustrated by Peter Carnavas. This one incorporates the tradition of Stir Up Sunday, and a brief factual account of the origin of the tradition is included at the end. For fans of Mr Darcy &#8211; the duck. Recommended for ages 5-8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/monster-christmas-tree-farts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6833 size-medium" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/monster-christmas-tree-farts-300x300.jpg" alt="monster-christmas-tree-farts" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p><em><strong>&#8220;His bauble bombs smell so bad I can&#8217;t wrap presents in my room&#8230;&#8221;</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>: There is a Monster Under My Christmas Tree Who Farts</p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: Harper Collins / ABC Books</p>
<p><strong>Author/Illustrator</strong>: Tim Miller and Matt Stanton</p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>: I cannot believe I just typed that title on my blog. Sigh. Ok, ok, so it&#8217;s not my style &#8211; but it is bound to appeal to some kids this Christmas. And to Uncles. Lots and lots of uncles. Recommended for Uncles aged 20-50.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas-Other-2014.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6834 size-large" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Christmas-Other-2014-1024x341.jpg" alt="Christmas-Other-2014" width="604" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>Other highly recommended new releases to look out for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>One Night</strong> (Penny Matthews / Stephen Michael King). This tells the story of the first Christmas through the eyes of the animals and is my pick for 2014.</li>
<li><strong>Tea and Sugar Christmas</strong> (Jane Jolly / Robert Ingpen). Based on the true story of the train that travelled across the Nullabor Plain weekly for over 80 years. Features critically acclaimed Australian illustrator Robert Ingpen.</li>
<li><strong>Little Dog and the Christmas Wish</strong> (Corinne Fenton / Robin Cowcher). The illustrations are quintessentially Melbourne, and Corinne Fenton&#8217;s stories are always poetically told. For dog lovers.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I don&#8217;t often share my works in progress apart from with my <a href="http://www.nswwc.org.au/">NSW Writer&#8217;s Centre</a> critique group, and my January <a href="http://katswhiskers.wordpress.com/whisker-of-poetry/month-of-poetry/">Month of Poetry</a> group. (Honestly, any serious writer should have a crit group.) But the lovely <a href="http://katrinagermein.com/new-in-2014/">Katrina Germein</a> tagged me to share lines 7-14 from a WIP, so I&#8217;m making an exception.<span id="more-6815"></span></p>
<p>This is a snippet from a non-fiction narrative picture book titled, <em><strong>Down By The Billabong</strong></em>. It scored 99% at the CYA Competition in 2013, but sadly has not been picked up by a publisher (YET!) so I&#8217;ve been fiddling with it again. Enjoy&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/640px-Billabong.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6819" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/640px-Billabong.jpg" alt="640px Billabong" width="640" height="427" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Down by the billabong</em></p>
<p><em>Middle of the day</em></p>
<p><em>When the sun burns hot</em></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">And the gum trees sway,</span></em></p>
<p><em>Wallaby naps,</em></p>
<p><em>Dragonfly rests,</em></p>
<p><em>Turtle snaps,</em></p>
<p><em>Warbler nests.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now it&#8217;s over to some of my amazing writerly friends from the above mentioned crit group. The challenge is to share 7 lines from page 7 or 77 of a current WIP, or lines 7-14 from a picture book WIP. Then tag other writers to continue the game. Are you brave enough <a href="http://ramonadavey.com/">Ramona Davey</a> and <a href="http://shellyunwin.com/">Shelly Unwin</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Author/Illustrator</strong>: <a href="http://www.profuselyillustrated.com/">David Mackintosh</a> <a href="http://katswhiskers.wordpress.com/"><br />
</a></p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/books/Lucky-Read-Aloud-David-Mackintosh/?isbn=9780007463053">Harper Collins</a></p>

<p><span id="more-6799"></span>When Mum announces there will be a surprise at dinner, two little boys let their imaginations run wild as they consider what it could be. Crinkly chips? A swimming pool? A trip to Hawaii&#8230;? Throughout the story, the underlying question is &#8220;What does it mean to be lucky?&#8221;</p>
<p><img title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /><em><strong>Lucky</strong></em> is a visual feast. David Mackintosh has a signature mixed media style, and readers of all ages will enjoy exploring the wild illustrations. It could also be useful for discussing visual literacy techniques in the classroom, including framing, text positioning, colour, reading path and salience.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lucky-elephant-image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6804" alt="lucky elephant image" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lucky-elephant-image-1024x652.jpg" width="604" height="384" /></a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">My personal opinion is that the strength of Mackintosh&#8217;s work is in the illustrations rather than the text, and while I don&#8217;t warm to the narrative &#8211; I can certainly appreciate the art. </span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed ages (can be useful during school holidays!)</li>
<li>Discussing visual literacy techniques</li>
<li>Discussing mixed media</li>
</ul>

</a></p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: <a href="http://www.harpercollins.com.au/books/Ratcatchers-Daughter-Pamela-Rushby/?isbn=9781743099766">Harper Collins</a><a href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/Book.aspx/1297/Bully%20on%20the%20Bus"><br />
</a></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span><img style="line-height: 1.5;" title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /></p>
<p><span id="more-6771"></span>I&#8217;ve met Pam several times at SCBWI meetings in Brisbane, and caught up with her recently at the <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/writer/cya-success-again/">CYA Conference</a>. Although I don&#8217;t usually review novels, I made an exception for this one as I was interested in using it for an English Unit I&#8217;ve been writing.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><em><strong>The Ratcatcher&#8217;s Daughter</strong></em> is a great read. The story is narrated by Issy, a thirteen year old girl living in Brisbane in 1900. When the Black Death touches not only her town, but her family, Issy steps up to take her father&#8217;s job eradicating plague-carrying rats. </span></p>
<p>This novel deals with life and death, and also tackles underlying issues of class and gender stereotypes &#8211; tying in perfectly with the Australian History Curriculum. I particularly enjoyed the references to newspapers throughout the text, and in the the inclusion of newspaper clippings in the appendix. These provide an opportunity for teachers to discuss the moral, ethical and social dilemmas encountered in propaganda, and also allow for comparison with current media.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Ratcatcher&#8217;s Daughter</strong></em> is one to order for your school library, and you&#8217;ll probably want multiple copies if your school is in Brisbane.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Upper Primary classrooms</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Novel study</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Exploring character</span></li>
<li>Historical fiction</li>
<li>Brisbane local history</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For the third year running, I was delighted to be shortlisted in the <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/news--updates/winners.html">CYA Competition</a> for unpublished authors in the non-fiction picture books category. And to be honest, I was absolutely stoked to take out both first and second place again with two manuscripts. <span id="more-6755"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cya-winner-2014a.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6756 aligncenter" alt="cya winner 2014a" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cya-winner-2014a.jpg" width="619" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how many unpublished awards one must win before finally landing a contract, but I must be close. Surely?!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my post about <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/award-winning-non-fiction/">winning last year</a> (1st, 2nd and 3rd). And <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/writing-recognition-cya-2012/">the year before</a> (2nd). Maybe next year will be the year I get to sit on the success panel &#8211; like so many of my writer friends.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge of having non-fiction picture books even <em>considered</em> by publishers, I remain determined. I adore those rich books that blur the lines between information and story. As a mother, I love reading them to my kids. As a teacher, I know that there is a need for them, and the new Australian Curriculum demands them. And as a writer, they are my first love.</p>
<p>So I will continue to write them. I will write them and I will win awards for them. I will challenge the notion that non-fiction is boring. I will be a voice for birds and bugs and trees and rocks and everything that amazes kids about the world around them. It still amazes me.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cath-2014-cya-winner.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6758 aligncenter" alt="cath 2014 cya winner" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/cath-2014-cya-winner.jpg" width="605" height="454" /></a></p>
<p>As always though, the best part of CYA is the networking. This year my dear friend Kathryn Apel and I were roomies (which meant we stayed up late like schoolgirls talking about, well &#8211; everything). Her verse novel <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/literacy/bully-on-the-bus/">Bully on the Bus</a> has been a sellout in its first week! I also managed to draw a few birds with <a href="http://petercarnavas.com/">Peter Carnavas</a>, chat with <a href="http://www.pamelarushby.com/">Pamela Rushby</a> about her latest novel, and catch up with <a href="http://www.michelleworthington.com/">Michelle Worthington</a>. So many friends, so little time.</p>

<p>My thanks to the organisers of <a href="http://www.cyaconference.com/">CYA</a>, and especially to the editors who give up their time to judge the competition and offer advice. Congrats to all of the winners in other categories too. &#8216;Til next year&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;This book is about a boy getting bullied every day on the school bus. When I read it I could feel what it&#8217;s like to be bullied. I felt like the main character was me. I hope this book teaches kids not to bully each other. The words in <em><strong>Bully on the Bus</strong></em> are so interesting, and the way it&#8217;s all in poems draws you in. The shape of the poems makes you think about the meaning. Once I started I had to finish the whole story.&#8221; (Miss 8)</p>

<p><em></em>Kat is a dear writing friend and colleague of mine. Maybe I cried when reading <strong><em>Bully on the Bus</em> </strong>because I know the author &#8211; but I suspect it has more to do with her incredible storytelling and poignant touch. (The last sentence on p91 really got me&#8230;)</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Teachers will love the verse novel format. Yes, verse novel. (<a href="http://uqp.uq.edu.au/skins/uqp/_uploads/samplechapter/Bully%20on%20the%20Bus_Sample_Chapter.pdf">See this link for an example of the layout</a>). Rather than being broken into chapters, each section is a poem which stands alone, yet contributes to the narrative. Poems are in free verse, and cleverly shaped to reflect the content. The poetry is easy to read because it&#8217;s not too abstract, but at the same time provides an early introduction to poetic devices and figurative language. </span></p>
<p>The comprehensive <a href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/store/images/Hi-RES/teachersnotes/1297/3322.pdf">teacher&#8217;s notes</a> are aligned with the Australian English Curriculum, and well worth downloading if you are an educator. The examples of poetic devices on specific pages will be useful for teachers (although I think metaphor features more heavily than is mentioned here), and I was pleased to see reference even to peritexts such as the dedication page. An excellent resource.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <em><strong>Bully on the Bus</strong></em> highly enough. As a teacher, a mother and a writer this one gets my tick of approval.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower Primary / Middle Primary classrooms</li>
<li>Exploring poetic forms (including shape poems)</li>
<li>Exploring poetic devices (including metaphor, simile and alliteration)</li>
<li>Family reading</li>
<li>Bullying theme</li>
</ul>

<p><em></em>There is a lot to like about <strong><em>Edward</em><em> and The Great Discovery,</em> </strong>the first picture book by New Frontier&#8217;s current Commissioning Editor.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Edward is the youngest in a long line of archaeologists &#8211; and he is yet to make his first big discovery. When he uncovers an unusual egg, he is disappointed to find that only a bird hatches out. Worse still, it is a bird that can&#8217;t fly. On a trip to the museum he realises of course that his bird is an extinct Dodo, which makes it a great discovery after all. Along the way he also discovers some truths about himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/edward-opening-layout.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6740" alt="edward opening layout" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/edward-opening-layout.jpg" width="600" height="344" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Edward and the Great Discovery</strong></em><strong> </strong>includes some beautiful illustrations, and the first opening of the stairwell and family photo gallery is a stand out. The cover is brilliantly executed and the endpapers are a delight. In fact, these two elements are probably the book&#8217;s best features. However, I think the italicised words <em>emphasised</em> on almost every opening are a little heavy handed, and in my opinion the entire last page is probably unnecessary. (I would have preferred a more open ending, allowing readers to consider for themselves what Edward had discovered in addition to the Dodo.)</p>
<p>The Teachers&#8217; Notes provided by New Frontier are disappointing and offer very little to educators so I have not included the link here. This is unfortunate as the book has some obvious curriculum connections.</p>
<p>All up, a beautifully presented book which families will enjoy sharing together.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Childhood / Lower Primary</li>
<li>Family reading</li>
<li>Museum excursions</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I should start by saying &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6713" alt="peppa pig" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg" width="286" height="176" /></a></p>
<p>But poor Peppa has been under fire recently thanks to a <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00283/full">new study</a> into the effect of anthropomorphic picture books on children&#8217;s knowledge about animals. <span id="more-6712"></span>Anthropomorphism is the literary device by which we give human characteristics to non-human things, often animals. Anthropomorphism has long been in prevalent in children&#8217;s literature: <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> are excellent examples, and then of course there are all of Beatrix Potter&#8217;s sweet books. The study found that &#8220;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">anthropomorphized animals in books may not only lead to less learning but also influence children&#8217;s conceptual knowledge of animals.&#8221; This, of course, has upset Peppa Pig fans. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is nothing wrong with anthropomorphism (and as I said &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig), but I have to agree with the study. </strong></p>
<p>The problem comes when children&#8217;s primary (or only) source of information about animals is a fantastical, human-esque version. Peppa Pig is a lovely pig. But if a child&#8217;s only experience of a pig is Peppa, there are going to be obvious issues with the child&#8217;s conceptual understanding of pigs.</p>
<p>You see, the things I like about Peppa are NOT the things that make her a pig. Quite the contrary. The things I like about Peppa are the humanistic elements of her character. I like that she&#8217;s from a nice family. She plays with her brother. She is polite to her mum. She laughs with her dad. They spend time together. Mostly in muddy puddles. But apart from the mud, none of those things are piggish at all!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6715" alt="pig in mud" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>If you look at the picture books on your child&#8217;s bookshelf, you will probably find the same thing over and over again. <strong>How many books does your child have with animals behaving humanly? And how many with animals actually behaving like animals??</strong> As the study says, &#8220;If we want children to learn new things about animals, we need to expose them to stories that present the animals and their environments in a biologically realistic manner, both in the way that they are depicted and the way they are described.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this is worth serious consideration for parents, teachers, and publishers. <strong>We need more non-fiction. Beautiful, information rich, interesting, read-it-again nonfiction.</strong> Books about piglets, bunnies, and owls might deliver warm fuzzies  &#8211; but our kids deserve to also have books about pig farming, real rabbits and birds of prey. Without a balance of both, they will grow up with a skewed, human-centred perspective of the natural world.</p>
