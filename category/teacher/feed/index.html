				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging as SquiggleMum in 2008, with an eight week old baby in my arms and a toddler under my feet. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but with two school aged kids and a busy life offline &#8211; I&#8217;m finally ready to let go of SquiggleMum. Well, the mum part anyway. <span id="more-6843"></span></p>
<p>I rarely write about parenting these days, and I feel that stories of my children&#8217;s adventures (or misadventures as the case may be) aren&#8217;t for me to share anymore. So I&#8217;m making a new home online, at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">squigglebooks.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglebooks.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6844" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/squigglebooks-logo1.png" alt="squigglebooks logo1" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">SquiggleBooks</a> you&#8217;ll find a mix of book reviews, posts about children&#8217;s literacy, thoughts about education, and tips for teachers. You&#8217;ll also be able to keep up with the latest news about my own writing career, and definitely be among the first to know <del>if</del> when I land that elusive picture book contract. It&#8217;s a pretty basic site for now, but I expect it will grow and change just as this blog has.</p>
<p>Before I go, I&#8217;d like to thank a bunch of people who have been part of the SquiggleMum journey. There have been thousands of comments on the blog over the years &#8211; <em>thank you</em> to each of you who took time to connect here. Some readers have become friends &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for staying in touch and encouraging me along the way. I have been privileged to write for a number of other parenting sites and share parenting advice on air &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for having me.  I have also won several awards and been invited to speak about blogging at conferences &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for the opportunity. Thank you to the bloggers who have been with me since the beginning &#8211; especially Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a>, as well as Kate from <a href="http://picklebums.com">Picklebums</a>, and Kelly from <a href="http://beafunmum.com/">Be A Fun Mum</a>. (There are too many others to name!)</p>
<p>I hope that many of you will join me in this next chapter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Blessings,</h2>
<h2>Cath / SquiggleMum.</h2>

<p><strong>Author/</strong><strong>Illustrator</strong>:  <a href="http://www.christinesharp.com/">Christine Sharp</a></p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: <a href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book.aspx/1319/Sylvia">UQPress</a></p>
<p><span id="more-6810"></span><a href="http://www.newfrontier.com.au/"><strong style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;">SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong><span style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;">:</span><img style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;" title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /></a></p>
<p><em></em>As soon as I heard about <strong><em>S</em><em>ylvia,</em> </strong>I couldn&#8217;t wait to get my hands on this delightful picture book. Sylvia the Snail is in love with Simon the Gardener &#8211; or at least his produce. She pines for his parsley and peas, and thinks his spinach and strawberries are scrumptious. Sadly, the feeling is not mutual, at least in the beginning.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sylvia-snail-image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6812" alt="Sylvia snail image" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sylvia-snail-image.jpg" width="591" height="464" /></a></p>
<p>Early childhood educators will love <em><strong>Sylvia</strong></em>. The story ties in nicely with Sustainability (a cross-curricula priority in the Australian Curriculum) and any unit about growth and living things. The text is full of rich vocabulary (<em>luscious, scrumptious, defeated, smitten, persistence, salute&#8230;</em>) and I am a big fan of texts which embrace interesting descriptive language instead of shying away from it. Strong alliteration features throughout, and will be easy for young readers to identify.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The illustrations are delicious, and I especially like the way readers can see above and below the ground. The changing point of view between Sylvia&#8217;s perspective and Simon&#8217;s is very well done, and the juxtaposition of the two perspectives on the opening spread makes for a wonderful beginning. Also worth discussing with students here is the way Sharp has given equal size, and therefore importance, to both characters. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">UQPress always do a great job with their </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/store/images/Hi-RES/teachersnotes/1319/3435.pdf">teacher&#8217;s notes</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, and these ones are well worth downloading (although I would love to see direct links with Outcomes). </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">My only criticism of this picture book is the inclusion of the tiny plane as I would have preferred something more organic in the narrative resolution. It&#8217;s only a small comment though, and doesn&#8217;t stop <em><strong>Sylvia</strong></em> from being an early childhood text I highly recommend. </span></p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Childhood / Lower Primary</li>
<li>Classroom reading</li>
<li>Discussing new vocabulary</li>
<li>Introducing alliteration</li>
<li>Discussing text positioning</li>

<p><span id="more-6799"></span>When Mum announces there will be a surprise at dinner, two little boys let their imaginations run wild as they consider what it could be. Crinkly chips? A swimming pool? A trip to Hawaii&#8230;? Throughout the story, the underlying question is &#8220;What does it mean to be lucky?&#8221;</p>
<p><img title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /><em><strong>Lucky</strong></em> is a visual feast. David Mackintosh has a signature mixed media style, and readers of all ages will enjoy exploring the wild illustrations. It could also be useful for discussing visual literacy techniques in the classroom, including framing, text positioning, colour, reading path and salience.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lucky-elephant-image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6804" alt="lucky elephant image" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lucky-elephant-image-1024x652.jpg" width="604" height="384" /></a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">My personal opinion is that the strength of Mackintosh&#8217;s work is in the illustrations rather than the text, and while I don&#8217;t warm to the narrative &#8211; I can certainly appreciate the art. </span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed ages (can be useful during school holidays!)</li>
<li>Discussing visual literacy techniques</li>
<li>Discussing mixed media</li>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The &#8220;right&#8221; way to teach young children to read has been up for debate this week, following NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli&#8217;s announcement that universities will be required to teach phonics to preservice teachers. (See this article via <a href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/education-minister-orders-universities-to-teach-phonics-or-face-losing-accreditation/story-fni0cx12-1227019125456?nk=05c34a3558a9475e26ca1faa2730345c">The Daily Telegraph</a> for the story).<span id="more-6786"></span></p>
<p>I did my B.Ed in the mid nineties &#8211; and must admit that I learnt very little about <em>phonics</em> in my degree. (<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Although out on prac, I encountered a range of phonics programs adopted by schools.) </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I did however learn a great deal about </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">whole language </em>in my undergrad subjects,<span style="line-height: 1.5;"> and about the constructivist approach to reading instruction which has greatly impacted my teaching. </span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/teaching-teachers.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6796" alt="teaching teachers" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/teaching-teachers.jpg" width="558" height="431" /></a></p>
<p>In my opinion, there shouldn&#8217;t be a <em>phonics</em> vs <em>whole language</em> war, because it isn&#8217;t necessarily either / or. And the truth is, when it comes down to classroom teachers &#8211; there ISN&#8217;T a war. We are all saying the same thing: <strong>our students need both</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Phonics are important. The ability to make sounds from symbols enables the reader to attempt unfamiliar words. But an understanding of whole language is important too because reading is about more than just sounds &#8211; it&#8217;s about making meaning. If you read but don&#8217;t understand, what&#8217;s the point? </span></p>
<p>I threw this topic out to my colleagues and readers (without giving my opinion), and unsurprisingly their comments confirmed my suspicions. Good teachers know that phonics are important. They also know that not all words can be sounded out, and that meaning can lie beyond graphemes. Here are some of their thoughts:</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/readers-thoughts-phonics.png"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6791" alt="readers thoughts phonics" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/readers-thoughts-phonics.png" width="502" height="508" /></a></p>
<p><strong>So here is my summary:</strong></p>
<p><em>Dear Universities. Please incorporate phonics into undergrad teacher education, but don&#8217;t ditch the great stuff you are already doing.</em></p>
<p><em>Dear Teachers. Please keep being amazing, and continue adapting your methods to suit the needs of your learners. </em></p>
<p><em><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Dear Goverment. Please be careful what you mandate. Rarely, if ever, is a single methodology better than a multifaceted approach, and we could lose more than we gain.</span></em></p>
<p><em>Dear Parents. Please don&#8217;t get drawn into the media-fuelled, government fed  debate. Just keep reading aloud daily to your kids. It has more impact than you can possibly imagine. </em></p>
<p><strong>Any further thoughts you would like to add&#8230;?</strong></p>

<p><img title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /><em><strong>Look and See</strong></em> is great for beginning readers. My five year old has just started on home readers, and was able to independently read it after hearing it a couple of times. The text contains a great percentage of easily recognised high frequency words (&#8220;sight words&#8221;) which will help beginners to experience early success. The rhyme structure also assists with text prediction.</p>
<p>Author/Illustrator Shane Morgan is a descendent of the Yorta Yorta peoples of Victoria. His cheeky illustrations will get a giggle out of young readers.</p>

<p><span id="more-6771"></span>I&#8217;ve met Pam several times at SCBWI meetings in Brisbane, and caught up with her recently at the <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/writer/cya-success-again/">CYA Conference</a>. Although I don&#8217;t usually review novels, I made an exception for this one as I was interested in using it for an English Unit I&#8217;ve been writing.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><em><strong>The Ratcatcher&#8217;s Daughter</strong></em> is a great read. The story is narrated by Issy, a thirteen year old girl living in Brisbane in 1900. When the Black Death touches not only her town, but her family, Issy steps up to take her father&#8217;s job eradicating plague-carrying rats. </span></p>
<p>This novel deals with life and death, and also tackles underlying issues of class and gender stereotypes &#8211; tying in perfectly with the Australian History Curriculum. I particularly enjoyed the references to newspapers throughout the text, and in the the inclusion of newspaper clippings in the appendix. These provide an opportunity for teachers to discuss the moral, ethical and social dilemmas encountered in propaganda, and also allow for comparison with current media.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Ratcatcher&#8217;s Daughter</strong></em> is one to order for your school library, and you&#8217;ll probably want multiple copies if your school is in Brisbane.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Upper Primary classrooms</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Novel study</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Exploring character</span></li>
<li>Historical fiction</li>
<li>Brisbane local history</li>
</ul>

<p>&#8220;This book is about a boy getting bullied every day on the school bus. When I read it I could feel what it&#8217;s like to be bullied. I felt like the main character was me. I hope this book teaches kids not to bully each other. The words in <em><strong>Bully on the Bus</strong></em> are so interesting, and the way it&#8217;s all in poems draws you in. The shape of the poems makes you think about the meaning. Once I started I had to finish the whole story.&#8221; (Miss 8)</p>

<p><em></em>Kat is a dear writing friend and colleague of mine. Maybe I cried when reading <strong><em>Bully on the Bus</em> </strong>because I know the author &#8211; but I suspect it has more to do with her incredible storytelling and poignant touch. (The last sentence on p91 really got me&#8230;)</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Teachers will love the verse novel format. Yes, verse novel. (<a href="http://uqp.uq.edu.au/skins/uqp/_uploads/samplechapter/Bully%20on%20the%20Bus_Sample_Chapter.pdf">See this link for an example of the layout</a>). Rather than being broken into chapters, each section is a poem which stands alone, yet contributes to the narrative. Poems are in free verse, and cleverly shaped to reflect the content. The poetry is easy to read because it&#8217;s not too abstract, but at the same time provides an early introduction to poetic devices and figurative language. </span></p>
<p>The comprehensive <a href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/store/images/Hi-RES/teachersnotes/1297/3322.pdf">teacher&#8217;s notes</a> are aligned with the Australian English Curriculum, and well worth downloading if you are an educator. The examples of poetic devices on specific pages will be useful for teachers (although I think metaphor features more heavily than is mentioned here), and I was pleased to see reference even to peritexts such as the dedication page. An excellent resource.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <em><strong>Bully on the Bus</strong></em> highly enough. As a teacher, a mother and a writer this one gets my tick of approval.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower Primary / Middle Primary classrooms</li>
<li>Exploring poetic forms (including shape poems)</li>
<li>Exploring poetic devices (including metaphor, simile and alliteration)</li>
<li>Family reading</li>
<li>Bullying theme</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I think I should start by saying &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6713" alt="peppa pig" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/peppa-pig.jpeg" width="286" height="176" /></a></p>
<p>But poor Peppa has been under fire recently thanks to a <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00283/full">new study</a> into the effect of anthropomorphic picture books on children&#8217;s knowledge about animals. <span id="more-6712"></span>Anthropomorphism is the literary device by which we give human characteristics to non-human things, often animals. Anthropomorphism has long been in prevalent in children&#8217;s literature: <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, and <em>The Wind in the Willows</em> are excellent examples, and then of course there are all of Beatrix Potter&#8217;s sweet books. The study found that &#8220;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">anthropomorphized animals in books may not only lead to less learning but also influence children&#8217;s conceptual knowledge of animals.&#8221; This, of course, has upset Peppa Pig fans. </span></p>
<p><strong>There is nothing wrong with anthropomorphism (and as I said &#8211; I <em>do</em> like Peppa Pig), but I have to agree with the study. </strong></p>
<p>The problem comes when children&#8217;s primary (or only) source of information about animals is a fantastical, human-esque version. Peppa Pig is a lovely pig. But if a child&#8217;s only experience of a pig is Peppa, there are going to be obvious issues with the child&#8217;s conceptual understanding of pigs.</p>
<p>You see, the things I like about Peppa are NOT the things that make her a pig. Quite the contrary. The things I like about Peppa are the humanistic elements of her character. I like that she&#8217;s from a nice family. She plays with her brother. She is polite to her mum. She laughs with her dad. They spend time together. Mostly in muddy puddles. But apart from the mud, none of those things are piggish at all!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-6715" alt="pig in mud" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/pig-in-mud-300x190.jpg" width="300" height="190" /></a></p>
<p>If you look at the picture books on your child&#8217;s bookshelf, you will probably find the same thing over and over again. <strong>How many books does your child have with animals behaving humanly? And how many with animals actually behaving like animals??</strong> As the study says, &#8220;If we want children to learn new things about animals, we need to expose them to stories that present the animals and their environments in a biologically realistic manner, both in the way that they are depicted and the way they are described.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think this is worth serious consideration for parents, teachers, and publishers. <strong>We need more non-fiction. Beautiful, information rich, interesting, read-it-again nonfiction.</strong> Books about piglets, bunnies, and owls might deliver warm fuzzies  &#8211; but our kids deserve to also have books about pig farming, real rabbits and birds of prey. Without a balance of both, they will grow up with a skewed, human-centred perspective of the natural world.</p>

<p><strong>SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong>:<span id="more-6655"></span></p>
<p>2014 marks the beginning of the centenary commemorations of World War 1, and perfectly timed is the release of <em><strong>The</strong><strong> Poppy</strong></em><strong> </strong> from Ford St.</p>
<p>Several picture book titles are currently available around the theme of ANZAC Day (and I expect we will see more this year).  This one tells the story of Australia&#8217;s connection with Villers-Bretonneux; a small French village where the flags of Australia and France still fly side by side today.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Poppy</strong> </em>is an excellent book for classroom use, with much to explore and discuss. Author-Illustrator Andrew Plant travelled twice to Villers-Bretonnuex and spent two years researching, designing, and painting &#8211; and it shows. There are over 60 paintings in the book, rich with detail about the buildings, monuments, carvings and streets of the village. Of particular interest is the black background of each page, mirrored in the glossy black cover, and the way the black serves to &#8220;frame&#8221; each of the paintings. Plant cleverly uses multiple frames of the same image, showing readers a close up view and then zooming out to an aerial perspective. This gives some insight into the magnitude of war, and its far reaching effects. The only non-black pages are the endpapers, which are maps of the village of Villers-Bretonneux and the Australian National Memorial in France.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Poppy</strong></em> is bold, and appropriately heavy. While it is not a style I personally gravitate towards, I highly recommend it for exploring themes around ANZAC day in the classroom.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>ANZAC Day preparation</li>
<li>Teachers of middle &#8211; upper primary</li>
<li>Family discussion about war</li>
<li>Symbolism of the poppy</li>
</ul>
