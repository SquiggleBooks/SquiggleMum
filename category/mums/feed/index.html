				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><em>New state, new city, new suburb.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>New house, new yard, new neighbourhood.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>New school, new church, new shopping centre.<span id="more-6310"></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/garie-beach.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6315" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/garie-beach.jpeg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Garie Beach, <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Royal-National-Park">Royal National Park</a>, NSW)</p>
<p>New things are exciting, but also a little unsettling. And when almost everything in your world is new, life can be very unsettled. I&#8217;m discovering that both holding on to the old, and embracing the new, are important elements in establishing life in a new place. Here are some things I&#8217;ve been doing to help my kids with the transition:</p>
<p>1.  Holding on to the old:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Beds</strong>. Same beds, same sheets, same pjs. There&#8217;s something incredibly normalising about sleeping in your own bed.</li>
<li><strong>Routine</strong>. The same morning <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/routine-charts-for-easy-starts/">routine</a> chart that was on the fridge in Brisbane, is still on the fridge in Sydney. It&#8217;s business as usual on school mornings&#8230; make bed, uniform on, breakfast, teeth brushing, hair done, unstack dishwasher, pack bag. The uniforms might be different, but nothing else has changed there.</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>. Holding on to special friendships is important. Miss 7 has put framed photographs of her friends in pride of place in her bedroom. She has also sent a few text messages on my phone, and started some letter writing.</li>
</ul>
<div>2.  Embracing the new:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Outdoor play</strong>. Our new yard is very different from the backyard the kids knew and loved in <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/goodbye-brisbane/">Brisbane</a>. For the first time ever, we have a flat patch of grass &#8211; so we bought a trampoline! Some serious jumping is great for warming up chilly little bodies who are used to a warmer climate.</li>
<li><strong>Exploring</strong>. Sydney is a beautiful part of the world. The city is big and busy, but away from the traffic there are rivers, bays, beaches and bushland to explore. While our family has some space from weekend commitments and after school activities, we are happily exploring <a href="http://www.sutherlandshireaustralia.com.au/">Sutherland Shire</a> where we now call home. (Pic above is in nearby <a href="http://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/Royal-National-Park">Royal National Park</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Friends</strong>. &#8220;Make new friends, but keep the old. One is silver, the other gold.&#8221; Making new friends is important in feeling like you belong in a place. As I encourage the kids to introduce themselves to other children, I am also endeavouring to lead by example and be proactive about meeting other mums myself.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Moving interstate with a young family is a big deal. It&#8217;s early days yet, but so far so good&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong>:</p>
<p>Pete is a friend and colleague. He continues to go from strength to strength with New Frontier, producing stories full of warm and sensitive characters. In <em>The Children Who Loved Books</em>, he challenges the notion that &#8220;stuff&#8221; makes us happy. The two children in the story, Angus and Lucy, don&#8217;t have very much &#8211; but with books and each other they have pretty much everything they need.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower primary</li>
<li>Family reading, followed by discussion about wants vs needs</li>
<li>Community story telling, particularly in lower socio economic areas</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/squigkids-dec12.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6182" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/squigkids-dec12.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="346" /></a></p>
<p>Hello again! It&#8217;s been very good for me to take a break from blogging for the past few months. At first I felt guilty, then relieved. Only after that could I really think about what I want to do with this little patch of the online world.<span id="more-6168"></span></p>
<p>I love being a blogger and I&#8217;m not ready to give it up yet. It has been a huge blessing in my life and I&#8217;ve had so many wonderful experiences and opportunities through blogging. That said, in order to create space for the &#8220;other&#8221; writing I do (children&#8217;s books &#8211; the reason I started blogging in the first place), I need to make a few changes.</p>
<p>Here are some things I will NOT do in 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>general PR posts</li>
<li>check stats</li>
<li>compare my blog</li>
<li>say &#8220;yes&#8221; without really thinking it through</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some things I WILL do in 2013:</p>
<ul>
<li>post weekly (weekly-ish)</li>
<li>review new release picture books</li>
<li>submit more of my own manuscripts to publishers!</li>
<li>say &#8220;no&#8221; without feeling guilty</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but I do think a new year provides an opportunity to assess our lives and consider the direction we are heading. I&#8217;ve noticed a few other bloggers and friends have chosen a word for the year. One of my closest girlfriends has embraced the word <strong>nourish</strong>.</p>
<p>I think my word for this year will be <strong>blessed</strong>. My husband and kids are an incredible blessing. I&#8217;m blessed by friends, my job, our home, our church, the blogging community, and so much more. If you follow me on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum">facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum">twitter</a> or <a href="http://pinterest.com/squigglemum">pinterest</a>, I&#8217;ll be using the hashtag <strong>#blessed</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>So what about you? Which word will you aspire to in 2013?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/blessed-22.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6178" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/blessed-22.png" alt="" width="644" height="245" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are wondering why this blog has been paused, here are some things I&#8217;m wondering at the moment too:<span id="more-6149"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>I wonder if it is now helping or hindering my journey as an author?</li>
<li>I wonder if, after 400 posts from me and 5,000 comments from you (thank you!!), this blog has simply run its course?</li>
<li>I wonder how long my children&#8217;s stories are mine to share? They are growing up so fast!</li>
<li>I wonder if the endless requests to promote this and attend that have finally taken their toll? I am grateful for the wonderful opportunities blogging has brought me, but my inbox is a constant stream of PR requests and I turn down 95% of them.</li>
<li>I wonder if it is time to launch something new? And if I do, I wonder if you&#8217;ll come with me??</li>
<li>I wonder if taking the time to wonder is more important than we realise?</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Don&#8217;t laugh. I might be all tech savvy with my iPad and iPhone and MacBook &#8211; but I cannot live without a paper diary!  I&#8217;ve always opted for a small one that I can keep in my handbag, but when I started working part time a few weeks ago I knew I needed to graduate to something more substantial.<span id="more-6074"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/innerb-open.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6077" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/innerb-open.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="338" /></a></p>
<p>Hellloooo <a href="http://www.inner-b.com/">Inner B</a>!  I jumped at the chance to try out their Mum Organiser*.  Here are 5 things I LOVE about it:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s robust.</strong>  I give my things a pretty good workout, and this diary is in and out of my bag several times a day. It&#8217;s really well made, the binder is strong, and I&#8217;m confident it will go the distance!</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s refillable.</strong>  Next year&#8217;s diary will only set me back $16.95 which is the cost of the 2013 refills.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s pretty.</strong>  I know that sounds shallow, but a visually appealing diary does help me to approach daily tasks more positively.  The Mum Organiser comes in three fresh shades.  No cutesy cartoons or tacky taglines here. Just good design and happy colour.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s well thought out.</strong>  I really like the monthly dividers, and the monthly overview at the start of each section. I also appreciate the week to a double page layout.  I cope with my <span style="color: #000000"><del>insanely</del> <del>ridiculously</del></span> busy schedule much better when I can easily scan a month or a week at a time.   The business card pockets at the front are great, plus I&#8217;m glad there&#8217;s space for a pen to permanently live in my diary.</li>
<li><strong>It&#8217;s made for me.</strong>  Well, not me exactly&#8230; but it is made for mums, with special consideration for things mums tend to write in their diaries.  And it is made for those Down Under, with Australian and New Zealand school holidays and public holidays marked. (Yay!)</li>
</ol>
<p>The only small criticism I have for the <a href="http://www.inner-b.com/">Inner B Mum Organiser</a> is that it is a little tricky to write close to the binder rings &#8211; but then again, without the binder it wouldn&#8217;t be refillable.  All in all I think this is a great product, particularly for mums like me who juggle part time work with full time parenting.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/InnerB-Mum-colours-1.jpg"><img class="alignright  wp-image-6078" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/InnerB-Mum-colours-1.jpg" alt="" width="294" height="441" /></a>To celebrate Mothers Day this weekend, I have one Mum Organiser to give away valued at $44.95 thanks to the amazing Valerie Petersen at Inner B.  All you have to do is leave a comment sharing why YOU need a Mummy Organiser!  </strong></p>
<p>Competition is open to Aussie residents only. One entry per person please. Winner will be drawn at random on Sunday 20/5/12 8pm Qld time.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://livinglocurto.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5904" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Morning_cards-livinglocurto.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><em></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The start of the day can be harrowing, especially if you have kids of different ages who need to get to different places!  The only way I know of getting everyone out of the door on time and with everything they need, is to establish good routines and stick to them.  Routine charts can be incredibly helpful for a child&#8217;s growing independence.  Young kids who can manage a few steps independently in the morning, become kids who are responsible for their own school materials, and then become teens who are capable of managing their own timetables.</p>
<p><span id="more-5901"></span></p>
<p>I chatted with Liam, Robbie and Jo on air this morning about routine charts on Brisbane&#8217;s 96Five.  If you missed it, check out the <a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=11331">podcast</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=11331"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5902" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/96five.gif" alt="" width="223" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Summary points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t confuse reward charts with routine charts</li>
<li>Move from photographs, to pictorial symbols, to words and symbols, then finally to timetables</li>
<li>Keep it age appropriate (a 4 year old can probably manage a 4 step morning routine&#8230; a 6 year old can manage 6 steps)</li>
<li>Remember that the aim is independence! Let them be responsible for their tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three ways to go about starting off a new routine chart for your child.  You can make it yourself from scratch, use one that others find works for them, or buy a ready-made one.  The advantage of making your own is that you can truly personalise it for your child.  Photos are especially effective for young kids.  Take a photo of the breakfast cereal, the kindy bag, the school uniform, the sunscreen&#8230; whatever!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to use a routine chart from other mums, try one of these:</p>
<p><a href="http://childhood101.com/2011/06/literacy-spot-24-routines-with-free-printable-picture-cards/">Childhood101</a> &#8211; I highly recommend Christie&#8217;s FREE printable routine cards for young kids. Photos ready to go!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.livinglocurto.com/2009/08/school-morning-routine-free-printable-cards/">Living Locurto</a> &#8211; This simple set of 4 FREE routine cards for young ones is print-ready.</p>
<p><a href="http://theorganisedhousewife.com.au/printables/kids-charts/">The Organised Housewife</a> &#8211; Print out Katrina&#8217;s FREE morning or evening routine chart for primary school kids.</p>
<p><a href="http://getbuttonedup.com/2011/11/03/tool-free-printable-kids-schedule-sheet/">Buttoned Up</a> &#8211; Try this FREE weekly schedule for kids in middle school. Laminate it, then fill it out together at the start of each week with a fine whiteboard marker.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.littlebillies.net/">Little Billies</a> &#8211; I <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/little-billies-giveaway/">reviewed these charts a couple of years ago</a> but sadly they are no longer available <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p style="text-align: center">Best of all: just hanging out together.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">__________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The verdict?</strong>  All four of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay at <a href="http://www.hiltonsurfersparadise.com.au/">The Hilton</a> on the Gold Coast.  The suite we stayed in was gorgeous, with superb finishes and beautiful views.  Staying with two kids under 5, I was grateful for the well equipped kitchenette and decent sized bath!  With only a double bed in the second bedroom the kids had to share &#8211; which was a novelty for our munchkins, but could be difficult with older kids.  The service was impeccable and breakfasts were a real highlight of our stay.  I would love to see the Hilton add a few little extras for families, like child friendly toiletries (such as bubble bath) and a small packet of wipes for messy fingers!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>What&#8217;s your idea of a luxury family holiday? </strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Miss 5 went to see the ballet today as a special treat with her Aunty.  The plan was for Mr 3 and I to hang out at the Queensland Museum for the morning &#8211; but it is currently closed for renovations in preparation for the <a href="http://www.southbank.qm.qld.gov.au/Events+and+Exhibitions/Events/2012/01/150th+birthday+celebrations">150th Birthday Party</a> in just over a week.  (There will be cake. Two METRES of cake. You heard it here&#8230;)</p>
<p>So, while the girls were doing this:<span id="more-5831"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/angelina-ballerina.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5832" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/angelina-ballerina.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">&#8230; the Boy and I opted for plan B: a <a href="http://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-transport/public-transport/citycat-ferry-services/index.htm">City Cat</a> ride!  It was quite poignant really.  One year ago today, the Brisbane River was a mess. (You can read my posts written during the disaster <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/brisbane-floods-processing-through-play/">here</a> and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/brisbane-floods-the-aftermath/">here</a>.)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">A year ago, the CBD was evacuated as rising water inundated the city.  Today it was business as usual, bustling with cars and people.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brisbane-city.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5833" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brisbane-city.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A year ago the sky was grey, and an ominous, eerie feeling loomed in the air.  As more reports from Grantham, Toowoomba, and other areas came to light, a rising sense of panic was palpable in the inner Brisbane suburbs.  Today the sky was big and blue and full of hope.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brisbane-river2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5834" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/brisbane-river2.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="597" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A year ago, a &#8220;mud army&#8221; of over 20, 000 Brissy locals turned out with gumboots and shovels to help those in need.  Talk about community spirit!  A year ago, there wasn&#8217;t a whole lot to smile about.  Today we were all smiles&#8230; <em><strong>especially</strong></em> when the Captain invited the kids on board to help him drive the boat!!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">We got to go up into the cabin, steer the big silver wheel, sit in the Captain&#8217;s seat and check out all the buttons and levers.  Captain Jack answered all of the kids&#8217; questions happily, including my son asking &#8220;<em>How do we go F-A-S-T?!</em>&#8221;   It was such a wonderful, unexpected experience.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/citycat-captain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5835" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/citycat-captain.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A year ago, the Brisbane River was a disaster.  <strong>Today, it was an absolute delight.</strong></p>

]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last month has been challenging journey for our little family through some ups and downs.</p>
<p>One of us came down with the flu, just as the other recovered.</p>
<p>One of us flew away from Brisbane, just as the other returned.</p>
<p>One family said hello to us, just as we say goodbye to another.</p>
<p>One friend welcomed a new baby, while heartbreakingly another will bury hers this week.<span id="more-5686"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mountain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5687" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mountain.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">When the going gets tough, priorities are stripped back to the barest essentials.  Social media seems unimportant when friends nearby desperately need a meal.  Keeping up with my reader comes second to keeping up with the housework.  And when we need to spend time as a family, talking about the big things of life and processing our feelings &#8211; the blog and everything else can wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I value my readers highly, and I love sharing with you all, but the truth is that you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> me.  My children and my husband, and close friends do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I didn&#8217;t start this post with, &#8220;<em>Sorry I haven&#8217;t blogged for a while&#8230;&#8221;</em> and I never will.  I&#8217;m not sorry.  Prioritising my family is the right thing to do.  I cannot possibly blog, speak or write with integrity about parenting if I don&#8217;t practise what I preach!  So please bear with me during the times I am less active online.  It simply means I am doing double-time offline; nurturing, loving and caring for those who truly need me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">And I know you understand that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">xx</p>
