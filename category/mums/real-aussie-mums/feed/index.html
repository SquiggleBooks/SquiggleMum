<p>Meet Rochelle Manners, mother of two gorgeous kids Julian and CoCo.  Rochelle started <a href="http://www.wombatbooks.com.au">Wombat Books</a> after self publishing her first book, and now publishes others under the <a href="http://www.mostlyformothers.com/">Mostly for Mothers</a> (for mums) and <a href="http://www.evenbeforepublishing.com/">Even Before</a> (for Christians) imprints.  Her latest anthology, <em>Even Before You Were Born</em> is a lovely collection of reflections on pregnancy and birth.  Ok, so I&#8217;m biased because I have two stories in the anthology!  The anthology will be launched next month and you will be able to buy signed copies here if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>Here are Rochelle&#8217;s five faves, and her biggest struggle as she juggles motherhood and publishing:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Favourite outing with your children</strong> &#8211; Visiting my mum and dads (the kids’ nanna and grandad’s) house. They have a huge yard, a trampoline and a pool we are looking forward to using in summer. Plus different and exciting toys and it is always a day trip as it is a bit of a drive.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with your children</strong> &#8211; My favourite or the kids?! I like drawing shapes and letters and trying to help him recognise them, but Julian’s attention span doesn’t last too long and he asks me to draw cars instead! So instead we end up playing cars (which baby CoCo likes doing too). I also like it now that CoCo is getting old enough to be fun to play with for Julian and they chase each other around the house (both crawling).</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal </strong>- Generally anything easy, but probably is Macaroni Chicken (sort of a pasta bake but nicer and using chicken and a chicken soup as a sauce).</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime story/stories</strong> &#8211; My son likes all the stories where the animals or characters fall down, cry or yawn so it is pretty amusing when he asks for the “crying” books.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down!</strong> &#8211; Catch up on work – ie my laptop is an addiction! I give myself too much to do, but I guess I enjoy it. Watching TV at the same time is fun too.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Finally, what&#8217;s your biggest struggle as a mum?</strong> &#8211; My biggest struggle is probably balancing it all – work, homelife and the kids – and making sure I don’t feel guilty by ensuring I spend enough time with the kids and keep up with  my responsibilities. I am still learning, but am also fairly efficient at getting work done. It seems like there is always more to do and the kids really are patient when I work. Balancing and making it so I need to work less and can spend more time the kids is definitely worthwhile. (I am going to <a href="http://www.mostlyformothers.com/workingandmothering.html">start on a book about that</a> soon.)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1614" title="christie" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/christie-200x300.jpg" alt="christie" width="200" height="300" />Ok, so I&#8217;m just sneaking in my Real Aussie Mum for September.  (Thanks to the reader who noticed I hadn&#8217;t featured a &#8220;Miss September&#8221; yet!  LOL)  <strong>Christie Burnett</strong> is an experienced Early Childhood  Teacher and a Mum who has worked with hundreds of families with young  children.  Even though we&#8217;ve never met in real life I&#8217;d call her a friend.  She blogs at <strong><a title="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/ CTRL + Click to follow link" href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Childhood 101</a></strong> about growing memorable, healthy childhoods, with lots of ideas, tips and  information for families.  Here are her five faves and her biggest struggle as she raises her daughter, Immy.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>1.  Favourite outing with your child &#8211; </strong>If you asked Immy, she would stay swimming but I hate being in my bathers so  I usually make my husband take her in!  We recently found a wonderful  toddlergym at our local PCYC which Immy adores.  They have a lovely big  space to run in, heaps of interesting equipment set up in a really, fun  attractive way that engages the children, and Immy loves running, jumping,  climbing, dancing and playing with balls and hoops.  I was really  uncoordinated as a child, so for me it is great to see Immy developing her  physical skills and enjoying active play at such a young age.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with your child &#8211; </strong>One of the major reasons we relocated back to Perth from Sydney this year,  was to be able to enjoy more of the great outdoors, both space-wise and  weather-wise!  So, playing outside in the garden would have to be a  favourite way for us to spend time together.  You&#8217;ll find us tending the  vegie patch, searching for snails and bugs, digging in the sand, jumping in  puddles, or just lying on the lawn looking at the clouds.</div>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal &#8211; </strong>I am really fortunate that Immy is a great eater and will eat almost  anything, especially vegetables.  For us, its not so much what is on the  table (especially given my domestic disaster status) but that we are all sitting  around the table together.  We have made it a priority to sit down together  as a family to eat dinner each night.  Immy especially enjoys it when  extended family members join us for a meal.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories &#8211; </strong>We visit the local library fortnightly so our bedtime stories change  regularly.  This week&#8217;s favourites include Handa&#8217;s Surprise (Eileen  Browne), Polar Bear, Polar Bear What Do You Hear? (Eric Carle) and Time for  Bed (Mem Fox).</div>
<div>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down &#8211; </strong>Sleep ins or hot baths!  If neither of these are available, chocolate is  a worthy substitute!</div>
<div>
<p><strong>6.  Finally, what&#8217;s your biggest struggle as a <span>mum</span>&#8230;? &#8211; </strong>My biggest struggle has been adapting to life as a Stay at Home Mum.  I  love being home with Immy and feel very blessed to have that opportunity but I  don&#8217;t enjoy feeling greater responsibility for the domestic drudgery as the  person &#8216;at home.&#8217;  I have also had to learn to manage a much tighter budget  thanks to our move to one income, which feels a bit cruel given that I have more  time to shop!</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1302" title="picklebum-family" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/picklebum-family-300x208.jpg" alt="picklebum-family" width="300" height="208" />My Real Aussie Mum for August is the down-to-earth <a href="http://picklebums.com/">Kate, from Picklebums</a>!  She is a very creative lady, and mum to twin girls and a gorgeous little boy.  Kate and her hubby are raising their brood on the Pickle Farm in &#8220;almost rural&#8221; Victoria.  Her <a href="http://picklebums.com/">blog</a> is always a great read, so pop over and say hi!  Here she shares her five faves, and her hardest struggle as a Mum.  (Thanks to the reader who requested I add Q6 to the Real Aussie Mums feature &#8211; you know who you are!)</p>
<p><strong>1. Favourite outing with your kids </strong>- We love going to the various Victorian Zoos &#8211; Melbourne Zoo, Healesville and Werribee Open Range Zoo. We have a zoo pass which makes even a couple of hours at the zoo very economical and it&#8217;s the perfect outing for kids of all ages, and adults too!  Best of all though,  we like spending time out with friends &#8211; no matter where we go!</p>
<div class="im">
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with your kids</strong> &#8211; My kids LOVE to do anything arty and crafty. Drawing, painting, collage, more drawing. Even our two year old loves to get into the paint and crayons.</div>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal</strong> &#8211; The girls are arguing over which is better &#8211; a vegetarian version of <a href="http://planningwithkids.com/">Planning With Kids</a> Mexi-bake or Porcupine Meatballs. Now our home made Naan Bread has entered the debate, as well as roast lamb and chicken noodle soup&#8230; Can you tell my kids love to eat?</p>
<div class="im">
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories &#8211; </strong>The big girls love to read the Sneezle books we have been given &#8211; A Midsummer Night&#8217;s Faery Tale, The Winter Child and The Faeries of Spring Cottage by Wendy Froud and Terri Windling. These engaging stories are a little longer than your average picture book, so we read a few pages a night, just right for those who are very, very fond of reading and faeries, like our girls. The pictures are just amazing. We&#8217;ve read them over and over, and even I am not bored of them yet.  The small boy loves any book with animals and all Dr Seuss books. His current favourite is the Foot Book!</div>
<div class="im">
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down! &#8211; </strong>I confess&#8230; I&#8217;m a tad computer obsessed, so I&#8217;ll happily vege out clicking through blogs or tweeting away. I also quite enjoy having a nice uninterrupted adult chat, accompanied by some yummy food, but that only happens once in a blue moon. Failing that, I&#8217;ll take a long, hot, bath any time!</div>
<div class="im">
<p><strong>6.  Finally, what&#8217;s your biggest struggle as a mum&#8230;? &#8211; </strong>Can I just answer <em>everything</em>? Oh&#8230;You want me to pick just one thing? I could write a book on this subject and still not be done! I struggle with finding my way and not sweating the small stuff. Sometimes I think I know exactly how I want to parent, other times I feel so completely and utterly lost and out of my depth. Sometimes I feel like I am totally kicking goals with this mothering gig, other times I feel like I am completely letting the team down. Oh and I worry way way WAY too much.</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_1047" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1047" title="becbadmummy_july" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/becbadmummy_july-300x225.jpg" alt="becbadmummy_july" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">First Mother&#39;s Day</p></div>
<p>Don&#8217;t be fooled by the name of her blog &#8211; Bec from <a href="http://www.bad-mummy.com/">BadMummy</a> is actually a great mummy.  Her beautiful daughter Erin was born 14 weeks prematurely, weighing less than a tub of margarine.  At just 428g she was the third smallest surviving bub born at the Royal Brisbane Women&#8217;s Hospital.  Now a big 2 years old, Erin keeps her mum on her toes!  Bec also blogs at <a href="http://www.brisbanepremmies.com/">Brisbane Premmies</a>, where she offers support to other parents of prems in her area.  Here are her five faves:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Favourite outing with your child:</strong> Up until recently our &#8220;big&#8221; outings have only been trips to the hospital, and who likes those?  At the moment we enjoy going to the library, and our local branch is just down the street.  Before winter started we went to Baby Rhyme Time.  After the August flu season has passed we&#8217;ll be back clapping and singing with the other kids.  Usually Erin&#8217;s just happy going anywhere she&#8217;s allowed to walk, walk, walk!</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with your child:</strong> Sleep time&#8230;?  Seriously though, pulling faces!  We sit together while she eats sometimes and chat.  I try to make very animated gestures and she tries to imitate.  I love it! (You know what they say about small minds&#8230;)</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal</strong>:  We&#8217;ve had a lot of problems with Erin&#8217;s eating.  Up until a few months ago she was considered a &#8220;non eater&#8221; which meant she took nothing or very little orally and had to be fed via a tube.  Since turning two though that&#8217;s all changed.  You wouldn&#8217;t recognise her now that she&#8217;s gaining weight and eating.  And boy does she eat!  One thing she&#8217;s always enjoy is spaghetti bolognaise.  Even when she&#8217;d only eat the smallest amount she&#8217;d always give spaghetti a go.</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories</strong>:  We don&#8217;t read stories at bedtime because our Little Miss is a little too excitable at that time of day!  Our bedtime routine usually entails a bath in lavender water with much splashing, and then I chase her around our bed while trying to dress her.  She thinks it&#8217;s great, possibly even the most fun she&#8217;s had all day.  After that we have cuddle time, some songs and then bed.  I do try books from time to time, but it usually comes to no good!</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down</strong>:  I am a big fan of a good book!  At the moment it&#8217;s anything that doesn&#8217;t require too much thought and that I can put down with a minute&#8217;s notice.  I&#8217;m also prone to flights of fancy.  It&#8217;s not uncommon for me to look entirely glazed over while cooking dinner.  If I close my eyes I could be almost anywhere&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">_______________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The 31st July marks National Premmie Day in Australia.  You can show your support for the <a href="http://www.prembaby.org.au/">National Premmie Foundation</a> by donating online, purchasing a Children&#8217;s Rose or attending a Premmie Day event.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Have you seen the funky designer cards and stationery at Earth &#38; Ink yet?  Janelle Keys is the creative force behind this gorgeous, environmentally friendly range, and she's my Real Aussie Mum for June!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="attachment_816" style="width: 259px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-medium wp-image-816" title="janelle_june" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/janelle_june-249x300.jpg" alt="janelle_june" width="249" height="300" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Janelle + 3 kids + 1 supportive hubby</p></div>
<p>Have you seen the funky designer cards and stationery at <a href="http://earthandink.com">Earth &amp; Ink</a> yet?  Janelle Keys is the creative force behind this gorgeous, environmentally friendly range, and she&#8217;s my Real Aussie Mum for June!  She started her <a href="http://www.picturethisgraphics.com.au">graphic design business</a> after eight years in the print industry, and now happily juggles motherhood with her own rapidly growing business.  Her three kids are aged 6, 4 and 3.  Here are her five faves:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Favourite outing with kids:</strong> Every school holidays our local library shows free movies.  The kids grab their pillows and bags of movie munchies and we sprawl out on the library floor.  It&#8217;s free, it&#8217;s fun, and it&#8217;s a great way to enterain the kids!</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with the kids:</strong> I don&#8217;t get to do it often, but I do love playing hide and seek indoors with the kids.  It&#8217;s a game that has us all laughing, and on those days when I seem to do a lot of work, it&#8217;s good just to turn the computer off for twenty minutes and have some fun.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal</strong>:  The humble spaghetti bolognaise is definitely one meal that will please everyone &#8211; which is fine by me!  I make it choc-full of grated veggies so I know the kids are getting a healthy meal.  It&#8217;s also my personal favourite because I make a double quantity of the bolognaise sauce,  leaving plenty for another meal during the week.  And that means a night off cooking (yay)!</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories</strong>:  I remember when my eldest son loved to hear &#8220;Cat in the Hat&#8221; every night.  I could almost recite it!  At the moment my daughter is really loving her &#8220;Letters from the King&#8221; devotion each night where she is learning how to be a real Princess.  I think it&#8217;s helping control some of those 4 year old tantrums&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down</strong>:  Friday night is my favourite time, knowing that I don&#8217;t have any client deadlines the next day.  I enjoy just watching tv with a good cup of tea.  It&#8217;s not much, but knowing that I don&#8217;t have to do anything for anyone is great!</p>

<p><span><strong>1.  Favourite outing with kids</strong> &#8211; </span>Our favourite family outing is a trip to <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/">Melbourne Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.melbourneaquarium.com.au/">Melbourne Aquarium</a> &amp; <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/Scienceworks/">Scienceworks</a>.  All 3 attractions are excellent value, particularly the Museum with children gaining free entry.  Annual family memberships make for excellent family value.  All 3 attractions are also excellent for all ages and a full ‘relaxing’ day could easily be spent.  Apart from these attractions we love to take advantage of the free City of Melbourne seasonal events such as Moomba, the unveiling of the Christmas Advent Calendar &amp;  Myer Christmas Windows, as well as holiday activities.  We love these!  We also recently had an awesome time at the <a href="http://www.bendigoeasterfestival.org.au/">Annual Easter Festival</a> in Bendigo where most of the attractions were free and rides were only $2.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with kids</strong> &#8211; Making things!  At our house we  love to create!  We have many ‘making books’ in the bookshelf and often have instant access to the internet where we can surf the web for creative projects to satisfy the moment!  From painting, drawing, making machines (with Dad), face painting, creating for future birthday parties (such as piñatas), and baking cakes &amp; muffins we attempt them all!  The odd performance concert is also a favourite with piano, clarinet, saxophone, recorders, dancing, music, acrobatics &amp; comedy sketches all a feature.  The concerts are recommended for ‘passing time’ for the children, however, I would recommend the audience has been ‘prepped’ with a cup of coffee (or 2 or 3!!).</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal</strong> &#8211; Definitely ‘Flat Things’ or known to the rest of the world as Fajita Wraps.  We love ‘Flat Things’ because every member of the family can choose their own filling and it&#8217;s kind of healthy at the same time (depending on the fillings).  Not to mention it is the easiest meal to prepare!</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories</strong> &#8211; This changes from day to day, however, we do read bedtime stories every evening.  At the moment, <em>Happy Birth Day</em> and <em>Hi New Baby</em> (Robie H. Harris) are favourites with the younger kids and the older children are enjoying having <em>Superfudge</em> (Judy Blume) read to them every evening.  My kids can relate to these books as they are currently adjusting to a new baby in the house.  Our little one is only 6 weeks old!</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down</strong>! &#8211; On the lounge with hubby in front of the TV with ‘secret takeaway’ from our local Greek Restaurant when the kids are in bed.  Of course funds don’t allow for the takeaway every evening so this is usually a fortnightly indulgence.  Surfing the web and lying down with a good book are also a treat!</p>

<p>Each month I&#8217;d like to share with you a <strong>Real Aussie Mum</strong>.  Despite the differences we all have as mothers, we can learn so much from each other just by sharing what works for us.  This month, meet Nicole from sunny Brisbane, Qld!  Before becoming a mum she was a teacher, and she has two kids:  Zoe is almost 3 and Riley is 7 months.  Here are her five faves:</p>
<p>1  <strong>Favourite outing with kids</strong> &#8211; a fortnightly trip into the city!  We catch a train in, play in a park, then head over to the library and museum.  The State Library (Qld) has a wonderful kids corner much like a playgroup with art, stories, kids yoga, music and more.  It changes all the time!  The Qld Museum has a wonderful dinosaurs area that just reopened.  Plus it has a huge whale and an aeroplane to wander under.  Then we have lunch and a play in the park at Southbank before hopping onto a CityCat (speedy river ferry).  We leave home at about 8:30am and get back any time between 2 and 4 in the afternoon.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt">2  <strong>Favourite at home activity with kids</strong> &#8211; Our favourite outside activity is the trampoline.  We all get on!  I sit with Riley while Zoe bounces.  It is an enclosed tramp so I fill it with balls from our ball pit.  Lots of fun!  Our favourite inside activity is getting lost in the playroom for hours at a time.  We dance, play music, read books, build with blocks, play playdough&#8230; You name it &#8211; it&#8217;s there!</p>
<p>3  <strong>Favourite family meal</strong> &#8211; We often eat <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/play-with-your-food-1-sausage-face/">funny faces</a> (ok, this is a must at least four nights a week)!  Our favourite meal to prepare for is take-out night.  We have a picnic on the family room floor, with a rug and plastic plates.  Zoe loves helping to dish up, and makes sure everyone has sauce, water, napkins, etc.  We love to cook chocolate brownies too, though I&#8217;m not sure they qualify as a meal&#8230;</p>
<p>4  <strong>Favourite bedtime story</strong> &#8211; Going On A Bear Hunt (by Michael Rosen).  Zoe can read it herself now, without looking at the words.  She loves acting it out with her bed friends and makes a cave under the covers.  Riley loves being a lion in the cave!</p>
<p>5  <strong>Favourite way to unwind!</strong> &#8211;  I don&#8217;t think I have unwound in three years!  I don&#8217;t have &#8220;just me&#8221; time, but I do enjoy sitting on my lounge swing out the back while I watch the kids play.  One day soon I will be able to have a cocktail on it while swinging.  I went from being pregnant to breast feeding, back to pregnant and more breastfeeding with about six weeks off in between!</p>
