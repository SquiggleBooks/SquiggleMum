		<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-674" title="img_6229" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_6229-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6229" width="300" height="225" />I love this photo of my son and I blogging.   Well, I&#8217;m blogging and he&#8217;s giving me material to write about!   As children of a software developer and a reasonably tech-savvy mama, my kids are bound to be fairly technically literate and exposed to the online world from a young age.   But how young is too young?   Or is there no such thing, given that these kids are growing up as &#8220;digital natives&#8221;?</p>
<p>My son is 8mths old.   A laptop is certainly not a foreign item to him.   He knows that we touch the keys, but not the screen.   He knows that we use gentle fingers on the keys and do not hit them!   He is allowed to play with an old keyboard, but knows Mummy&#8217;s laptop is <em>not</em> for touching.</p>
<p>My daughter has just turned 3.   She regularly emails family and friends, with help from me.   She independently types her name and inserts smileys (shift key and all) and knows how to change the size and colour of the font in her text.  She knows what Google is.   She knows my online name is SquiggleMum (and has asked her father if he is &#8220;SquiggleDaddy&#8221;).   She knows what a blog is.   She knows how to get out of a program she has inadvertently opened by pressing esc.   She knows how to insert a CD and plug in a USB mouse.   She knows we use computers to find information, to communicate with people, to share photos, to watch video and to listen to music.  I didn&#8217;t know most of these things until I was well into my teens!</p>
<p>I want my kids to be able to function effectively in the world they find themselves growing up in &#8211; but as their Mum I also want to protect them.  I want to expose them to new technologies without exposing them to danger.  And that means I need to make some decisions, sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Will I let them have their own email addresses?  Will I let them post to their own blog?  Will I let them claim their own Twitter profile?  E-literate parents are already gently leading their little ones into the blogosphere, or the twitterverse, or whatever you want to call it.  A prominent Aussie blogger&#8217;s son, for example, has his own Twitter profile and almost two hundred followers.  He&#8217;s two and a half years old.  Too  young?  Maybe, maybe not.  He might have a significant following, but the only person he follows online is his Daddy.  Obviously his dad is watching out for him.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&#8217;m happy with my kids sending and receiving emails via my address, having their faces and stories (selectively chosen) on my blog, and not having a presence on Twitter or Facebook.  I guess I&#8217;ll have to keep reviewing that though.  Technologies change rapidly and children grow fast!  What have you decided about the amount you will expose your kids to the online world?  I&#8217;d love you to share your opinion &#8211; but please do it sensitively as we are talking about real people&#8217;s kids.</p>

<p>My daughter always seems ready to embrace the next stage in life long before I am.  She was on the go before I was ready for her to crawl.  She was walking before I had good shoes for her little feet.  She climbed out of the cot before we had bought a single bed for her to move to.  You get the idea.  Today my little munchkin turned three.  She&#8217;s ready.  I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Three is the end of being a toddler.  I just got used to saying I have a baby and a toddler.  What do I have now?  She&#8217;s not a kid yet.  She&#8217;s still little.  Three is still little!  She still needs help with a knife and fork.  She still needs help climbing out of the bathtub.  She still needs someone to do up her buttons, brush her teeth and tie her pigtails.  She&#8217;s still little!!!</p>
<p>I guess if she&#8217;s ok with being somewhere between a toddler and a kid, I should be ok with that too.  Really it&#8217;s a special time, because she&#8217;s <em>just</em> big enough to be independent, and <em>just </em>little enough to still need her Mummy.  And I have a feeling this phase won&#8217;t last long.   I only have the rest of this year with her at home before she&#8217;ll be off to kindy!</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to Little Miss Three: my big little Mummy&#8217;s girl.  There&#8217;s a part of me that hopes she never completely grows up.</p>

		<p><em>My daughter turns three tomorrow, so I&#8217;m spending today doing the cake and getting things ready.  Thought I might <a href="http://www.scarymommy.com/flashback-friday-facebook-friends/">flashback</a> to this article I wrote in 2008 after her second birthday party.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-644" title="img_4332" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_4332-300x225.jpg" alt="img_4332" width="300" height="225" />Before becoming a mother I spent many years as a teacher.<span> </span>I planned excursions and celebrations and full scale musical productions.<span> </span>So I had no qualms about planning a little party for a two year old.<span> </span></p>
<p>I was quite pleased with my preparations.<span> </span>Low stress venue?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Age appropriate games?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Healthy but appetising morning tea?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Party bags that parents would be as pleased to receive as their children?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>The only thing I was slightly concerned about was the cake.</p>
<p>When I was growing up my mother had one of those Women’s Weekly cake books that everyone’s mum seemed to have.<span> </span>For a good two weeks leading up to a birthday my sister and I would pore over every picture as we tried to decide which cake would become the celebration’s centrepiece.<span> </span>A marshmallow Dolly Varden cake?<span> </span>Or a maypole cake with colourful ribbons and miniature dancing girls?<span> </span></p>
<p>With such fond childhood memories I looked forward to preparing a gorgeous butterfly cake for my own daughter’s birthday.<span> </span>That is, until the day before the party, when the realisation actually hit me.<span> </span>I think I had mistakenly come to the conclusion that cake decorating was a skill you automatically received during childbirth!<span> </span>You know, just one of those “mum things” that every mother is inherently capable of.<span> </span></p>
<p>I was starting to panic just a little when my sister rang to see how the party preparations were going.<span> </span>I told her nonchalantly that I only had the cake left to organise.<span> </span>My sister, who is far more competent in the kitchen than I am, cut straight through my pretence with a simple question.<span> </span>“What kind of icing are you using?” she asked.<span> </span>“You mean there’s more than one kind?!” I asked in return.<span> </span>As she laughed I said that sentence that I should say more often, even if it makes me cringe.<span> </span>“I think I need some help.”</p>
<p>My sister came over with creative ideas and beautiful cookbooks.<span> </span>(I noticed none of her books had bent pages or spilt ingredients on them but she doesn’t have children – yet.)<span> </span>Together we decided on a simple design, a basic icing, and a decorating plan of attack.<span> </span>Then she left me to it.<span> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_649" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-649" title="img_4451" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_4451-300x225.jpg" alt="img_4451" width="210" height="158" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Flitter Flutter</p></div>
<p>That cake was a labour of love for me.<span> </span>And it turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself.<span> </span>It took pride of place in the middle of the table, but in all honesty it wasn’t the centrepiece of the celebration.<span> </span>My daughter was.<span> </span>She looked like a little fairy princess, and her smile told me that she felt like one too.<span> </span>I realised almost too late that she wasn’t impressed by my organisational skills or culinary efforts.<span> </span>She was just so happy to be with her little friends, to have two candles to blow out, and to have her mummy fluttering around in a pair of wings just like her!<span> </span>Everything else was just, well, icing on the cake…</p>

		<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-624" title="rebecca_may" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/rebecca_may.jpg" alt="rebecca_may" width="242" height="346" />Meet the inspirational Rebecca Mason &#8211; <span>a wife, mother of 6 children (aged 6 wks to 10 yrs) and midwife living on the outskirts of Melbourne who has a passion for travelling and has a vision to inspire large families.  She is the founder of the <a href="http://www.familyvalue.com.au">Family Value </a>website which lists Aussie family attractions encourages them to bring back ‘Family Entry at Family Prices’.  Here are her five faves:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>1.  Favourite outing with kids</strong> &#8211; </span>Our favourite family outing is a trip to <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/">Melbourne Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.melbourneaquarium.com.au/">Melbourne Aquarium</a> &amp; <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/Scienceworks/">Scienceworks</a>.  All 3 attractions are excellent value, particularly the Museum with children gaining free entry.  Annual family memberships make for excellent family value.  All 3 attractions are also excellent for all ages and a full ‘relaxing’ day could easily be spent.  Apart from these attractions we love to take advantage of the free City of Melbourne seasonal events such as Moomba, the unveiling of the Christmas Advent Calendar &amp;  Myer Christmas Windows, as well as holiday activities.  We love these!  We also recently had an awesome time at the <a href="http://www.bendigoeasterfestival.org.au/">Annual Easter Festival</a> in Bendigo where most of the attractions were free and rides were only $2.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with kids</strong> &#8211; Making things!  At our house we  love to create!  We have many ‘making books’ in the bookshelf and often have instant access to the internet where we can surf the web for creative projects to satisfy the moment!  From painting, drawing, making machines (with Dad), face painting, creating for future birthday parties (such as piñatas), and baking cakes &amp; muffins we attempt them all!  The odd performance concert is also a favourite with piano, clarinet, saxophone, recorders, dancing, music, acrobatics &amp; comedy sketches all a feature.  The concerts are recommended for ‘passing time’ for the children, however, I would recommend the audience has been ‘prepped’ with a cup of coffee (or 2 or 3!!).</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal</strong> &#8211; Definitely ‘Flat Things’ or known to the rest of the world as Fajita Wraps.  We love ‘Flat Things’ because every member of the family can choose their own filling and it&#8217;s kind of healthy at the same time (depending on the fillings).  Not to mention it is the easiest meal to prepare!</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories</strong> &#8211; This changes from day to day, however, we do read bedtime stories every evening.  At the moment, <em>Happy Birth Day</em> and <em>Hi New Baby</em> (Robie H. Harris) are favourites with the younger kids and the older children are enjoying having <em>Superfudge</em> (Judy Blume) read to them every evening.  My kids can relate to these books as they are currently adjusting to a new baby in the house.  Our little one is only 6 weeks old!</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down</strong>! &#8211; On the lounge with hubby in front of the TV with ‘secret takeaway’ from our local Greek Restaurant when the kids are in bed.  Of course funds don’t allow for the takeaway every evening so this is usually a fortnightly indulgence.  Surfing the web and lying down with a good book are also a treat!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">__________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">You can find out more about Rebecca&#8217;s gorgeous family by visiting her <a href="http://blog.familyvalue.com.au">blog</a>.  I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d love you to stop by and leave a comment.  Do you know of another inspiring mum I could feature next month..?</p>

<p>Since becoming a mum, some changes have been harder to embrace than others.  My figure has changed &#8211; that gets me down sometimes.  My income has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s strange to work so hard at a job for zero pay!  My grocery list has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s now twice as long and includes milk that comes in 3L bottles.  My mornings have changed &#8211; anything past 7am now qualifies as a sleep in.  I could go on, but I know that focusing on the tough aspects of mothering doesn&#8217;t serve much of a useful purpose.  I might get a laugh out of it, but really it only makes me begrudge a choice I willingly and joyfully made.  I wanted to be a mum!  So this Mother&#8217;s Day, I&#8217;m going to focus on how my kids have changed me&#8230; for the better.</p>
<p>1.  My name has changed.  They call me Mummy and I love it.  (Ok, so my baby boy has only just started trying out a sound that vaguely resmembles mumumum&#8230;. but I&#8217;m counting it.)</p>
<p>2.  I&#8217;m more <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/waiting-game/">patient</a>.  If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog for a while you&#8217;ll know that this isn&#8217;t one of my strong suits.  My kids are constantly helping me in this area!</p>
<p>3. I appreciate me-time so much more.  Before becoming a mum I took this for granted.  I didn&#8217;t know what it meant to treasure time to myself, or time with a girlfriend, or time with my husband.</p>
<p>4. I&#8217;m less judgmental.    Oh how I&#8217;d love to take back some of the things I thought about other mothers, before I actually became one myself!</p>
<p>5.  My heart has changed.  I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happened.  It&#8217;s grown more sections or something.  I feel things I couldn&#8217;t feel before.  Sometimes my heart wants to break for my kids, and sometimes it wants to burst!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure all of these changes are permanent, and I&#8217;m glad.  I know my heart will never be the same again, and I hope that I keep growing in patience and working on my judgmental streak.  And one day, when I&#8217;m just &#8220;Mum&#8221; and not &#8220;Mummy&#8221; anymore, I hope I remember how it felt to have them look up at me and say my name.</p>
<p>How has becoming a mum changed you&#8230; for the better?</p>

<p>I am currently typing this article on my brand new shiny purple laptop because I had to sell my yellow car. Don’t quite follow? Read on&#8230;</p>
<p>It all came about because we are expecting our second child very soon. I always knew that my zippy little yellow hatchback wouldn’t cut it with two kids, and that I would eventually inherit my husband’s very sensible, very safe and practical silver sedan. I just didn’t expect to be so upset about the transition.</p>
<p>I don’t cry easily, even pregnant. So I caught my husband (and perhaps even myself) a little off guard when I cried a fountain of tears over saying goodbye to my little yellow car. It wasn’t that I desperately loved the vehicle. It was more that I loved what it represented. It was one of the last reminders of the girl I was in my pre-mum days. That car was a little piece of me on the road. Joyful, carefree, bold, with heaps of get-up-and-go. It was easy to drive and a dream to park. In my little fun-buggy I could go anywhere, do anything, and be completely independent. I felt like I was farewelling a part of myself as I farewelled my yellow car.</p>
<p>It seemed I had gone from having a colour-filled life to a life of grey. I cried my heart out and said to my husband, “I have your hand-me-down car, your hand-me-down computer and your mobile phone! There’s nothing left of ME anymore.” To his credit, my hubby was incredibly understanding. In fact he was the one who suggested the new laptop. Somehow he understood my need to retain a sense of self.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong – I love being a mum. It’s just that it’s important to me to remember who I am aside from being a mother. I will only be “Mummy” for a season. When my children one day grow up, and leave home, I don’t want to wonder who I am! So I need to keep some things in my life that remind me of who God created me to be. Joyful, carefree, bold, with heaps of get-up-and-go. Hence the shiny, purple laptop.</p>
<p>I use my computer daily. It’s my primary writing tool, my letter box, my 24hr help line and my link to the outside world. And I smile every time I use it because it’s so ME.</p>

<p>Each month I&#8217;d like to share with you a <strong>Real Aussie Mum</strong>.  Despite the differences we all have as mothers, we can learn so much from each other just by sharing what works for us.  This month, meet Nicole from sunny Brisbane, Qld!  Before becoming a mum she was a teacher, and she has two kids:  Zoe is almost 3 and Riley is 7 months.  Here are her five faves:</p>
<p>1  <strong>Favourite outing with kids</strong> &#8211; a fortnightly trip into the city!  We catch a train in, play in a park, then head over to the library and museum.  The State Library (Qld) has a wonderful kids corner much like a playgroup with art, stories, kids yoga, music and more.  It changes all the time!  The Qld Museum has a wonderful dinosaurs area that just reopened.  Plus it has a huge whale and an aeroplane to wander under.  Then we have lunch and a play in the park at Southbank before hopping onto a CityCat (speedy river ferry).  We leave home at about 8:30am and get back any time between 2 and 4 in the afternoon.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt">2  <strong>Favourite at home activity with kids</strong> &#8211; Our favourite outside activity is the trampoline.  We all get on!  I sit with Riley while Zoe bounces.  It is an enclosed tramp so I fill it with balls from our ball pit.  Lots of fun!  Our favourite inside activity is getting lost in the playroom for hours at a time.  We dance, play music, read books, build with blocks, play playdough&#8230; You name it &#8211; it&#8217;s there!</p>
<p>3  <strong>Favourite family meal</strong> &#8211; We often eat <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/play-with-your-food-1-sausage-face/">funny faces</a> (ok, this is a must at least four nights a week)!  Our favourite meal to prepare for is take-out night.  We have a picnic on the family room floor, with a rug and plastic plates.  Zoe loves helping to dish up, and makes sure everyone has sauce, water, napkins, etc.  We love to cook chocolate brownies too, though I&#8217;m not sure they qualify as a meal&#8230;</p>
<p>4  <strong>Favourite bedtime story</strong> &#8211; Going On A Bear Hunt (by Michael Rosen).  Zoe can read it herself now, without looking at the words.  She loves acting it out with her bed friends and makes a cave under the covers.  Riley loves being a lion in the cave!</p>
<p>5  <strong>Favourite way to unwind!</strong> &#8211;  I don&#8217;t think I have unwound in three years!  I don&#8217;t have &#8220;just me&#8221; time, but I do enjoy sitting on my lounge swing out the back while I watch the kids play.  One day soon I will be able to have a cocktail on it while swinging.  I went from being pregnant to breast feeding, back to pregnant and more breastfeeding with about six weeks off in between!</p>

<p>For both of my kids, I chose old names that have been out of fashion for a while and are on the way back in again.  I like old names because I feel like they&#8217;ve already proven their worth.  They&#8217;ve stood the test of time!  I like to make sure names have a nice meaning too.  But for me, the most important part is how the name sounds and feels to say.  I have to say names out loud.  I need to whisper them quietly, and I also need to say them firmly (because that&#8217;s something you do a whole lot when they are toddlers&#8230;)</p>
<p>I came across a great blog this week which is all about baby names.  If you&#8217;re expecting, or planning on more kids you might like to check out the <a href="http://nameisms.blogspot.com/">nameisms</a> blog too.</p>
<p>How did you choose the names you did for your kids?  I&#8217;d love you to leave a comment below.</p>

<p>1.  Start the day with a hot shower.  In the secret world of mums I&#8217;ve discovered that most of us only average a shower every second day!</p>
<p>2.  Eat breakfast.  We would never let our kids skip the most important meal of the day, but we justify forgoing our own nutritional needs because by 7am we&#8217;re already too busy.</p>
<p>3.  Have a plan for the day.  You don&#8217;t need to have a minute-by-minute timetable written up, but some idea of how the jobs to be achieved and appointments to be kept will fit in the with the kids&#8217; routines for the day certainly makes life easier.  Toddlers often cope better with the day too if they know what to expect.</p>
<p>4.  Take time out in the middle of the day.  Even if your kids are too old for a daytime sleep, you can insist on a mandatory &#8220;rest&#8221; time.  This allows kids to have some quiet time with reduced stimulus, and allows mums to take a sanity break.  Put the tv on, read a mag, close your eyes for a quick kip, have an unhurried cuppa&#8230;. give yourself the chance to reset for the afternoon.</p>
<p>5.  Have fun playing together.  Sometimes I find I&#8217;ve been so busy catching up on everything that needs doing that I haven&#8217;t actually played with my kids.  They might have played beside me, but it&#8217;s not the same as playing <em>with </em>me.  Give your kids your undivided attention for a block of time during the day doing what they want to do, and you&#8217;ll reap the rewards for it.</p>
<p>6.  Get dinner ready ahead of time, or plan for a meal with low prep time.  Go for one pot meals in winter (slow cookers are great for this) and simple salads in summer.</p>
<p>7.  Always have the number of at least one other mum-friend on speed dial.  And always, always, always call them when you need to.  Call if you need another mum&#8217;s advice, call if you&#8217;ve lost it with your kids and you need to calm down, call if you aren&#8217;t coping for whatever reason.  If you don&#8217;t call them when you need help, they won&#8217;t call you when they are at their wit&#8217;s end either.  You don&#8217;t have to be alone as a mum.  If you don&#8217;t have someone to call, email me!</p>
<p>8.  Drink coffee &#8211; lots of coffee.</p>
<p>9.  Read and pray with your kids at bedtime.  It&#8217;s a nice way to finish the day, regardless of how trying things may have been.  Tuck them in, kiss them and tell them you love them (even if you haven&#8217;t liked the way they&#8217;ve behaved&#8230;) then shut the door and breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>10.  Get to bed with your husband before you&#8217;re completely exhausted (oops&#8230; sorry Honey &#8211; will make it up to you tomorrow night).</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-352" title="img_5443" src="http://mysquiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img_5443-225x300.jpg" alt="img_5443" width="225" height="300" />&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s get this place tidied up!&#8221;  I said to my toddler, surveying the mess that was threatening to take over our home.  &#8220;Why Mummy?&#8221; she asked.  &#8220;Who&#8217;s coming over&#8230;?!&#8221;  I cringed, realising that my daughter thought we only cleaned up for visitors!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not one of those people who loves a surprise knock at the door.  No, not me.  I&#8217;m happy to have unexpected guests &#8211; as long as I have ten minutes notice.  You wouldn&#8217;t believe the cleaning frenzy that can happen in those few precious minutes.  Our place transforms from revolting to respectable in a very short span of time!</p>
<p>I have to wonder though if this is a good thing to be teaching my kids.  I&#8217;m glad my daughter knows that when people come over we want them to be able to find somewhere to sit without moving piles of folded washing or shoveling toys out of the way.  That is part of being hospitable and making others feel welcome.  But I don&#8217;t want her to think we only clean for guests, and that if no one is coming there&#8217;s no need to tidy!</p>
<p>Our home is not a dirty, smelly, messy place.  It just gets untidy easily.  We&#8217;re always busy living life!  Even a stay-home day is a busy day.  We get busy with outside activities, or craft projects, or the simple pleasure of play.  Mess is inevitable.</p>
<p>In the past my toddler and I have tidied up together before bath time.  Now that she has dropped her afternoon sleep she is quite difficult at this time of day!  To make matters worse my baby boy needs to be fed his mushy food then too.  And so, the house is left in a state of disarray.  My options are to clean up after the kids are in bed, or just leave it.  After all, it will end up in a mess again tomorrow and we&#8217;ll be fine unless the doorbell rings&#8230;</p>
<p>How do you deal with this in your home?  Do you clean throughout the day?  Tidy at the end?  Go on a cleaning binge when someone pulls into your driveway?  Ignore it altogether?  This houswife is desperately seeking tips from other mums!!!</p>
