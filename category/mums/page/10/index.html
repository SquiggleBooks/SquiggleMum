		<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>The Boys Are Back</em> is a beautiful film shot in South Australia, starring Clive Owen and directed by Scott Hicks, director of Shine.  Inspired by a true story, it is the touching tale of a father who finds himself raising two sons alone while grieving the loss of his wife.  As he transitions from part time parent to full on father he learns a lot about his children, and perhaps even more about himself.</p>
<p>Would you like a night out at the movies?  I can&#8217;t organise baby sitting for you, but I do have TEN DOUBLE PASSES to giveaway thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/HopscotchFilms">Hopscotch Films</a>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The first ten SquiggleMum subscribers (new or existing, by email or RSS) to leave a comment below will win.<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>Hopscotch were also kind enough to send Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/">Childhood 101</a> and I tickets to catch the flick, and while we saw the film on opposite sides of the country we enjoyed chatting about it online.  Here are some of our thoughts reflecting on the film:</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: So was it what you expected?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I really enjoyed the fact that the movie explored parenting from a male perspective and the relationship between Dads and sons.  Though obviously it is just one perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I enjoyed the Dad and boys perspective too. Especially in the light of having recently heard Steve Biddulph speak on raising boys, and the importance of the relationship between fathers and sons.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I found it really poignant when the Dad told his mother-in-law that his young son didn&#8217;t really know him, that they needed time to get to know each other and how to relate to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes, it made me wonder how many fathers would have to &#8220;get to know&#8221; their sons in the same situation.  And also made me wonder as a mum how I can facilitate my husband &#8220;knowing&#8221; my kids right now&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I think men generally relate differently to their children, and I think this generation of fathers especially have had a whole new set of expectations place upon them.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think this generation of fathers genuinely want to be Dads, want to spend time with their kids and want to be involved &#8211; but making it happen is hard.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: And society keeps pushing all of us to work longer and harder as members of the workforce which does not facilitate better family relationships in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: That was really highlighted in the movie: a dad pushed so hard at work that he chose to leave his kids overnight to save face with his employer.  No dad wants to be in that position.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Though wasn&#8217;t the older boy sweet and brave to offer to stay? I really felt for him when it all fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes &#8211; sweet and brave.  I hope I raise a boy who is sweet and brave, even if he doesn&#8217;t always get things right.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: So, how do we support our husbands to help them have the time and opportunity to be involved?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think we have to take a step back sometimes. As mums we can be control freaks!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: That is very true.  I think it is important for a child to have time one on one with each parent, as well as time together as a whole family.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I agree.  And while I absolutely think that parenting works best when both parents are on the same page, I think mums need to let dads do things their way without us criticising.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I also believe, it is about that being time truly being together too, not just watching the TV or doing chores around the home but having fun, laughing together, getting out and sharing unique experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Getting the most out of whatever time you have together.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: That is right, creating memories with children.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: But I have to say&#8230; if the memory making involves dad driving on the beach with a child on the bonnet of the car, I&#8217;d probably step in there!! LOL</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Well, sometimes what Mum doesn&#8217;t know can&#8217;t hurt her! LOL!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: There was a scene in the movie where the kid was bomb diving into the spa bath. That was a memory making moment I would have missed as a mum, because I would have stepped in too soon, and worried about the mess.  Maybe sometimes a memory is worth the mess??</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I don&#8217;t think it was the mess that worried me, it was the chance of him hurting himself that had me grimacing!  But then, I am pretty tolerant of mess!  Fun mess, not domestic mess!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Did the flying fox in the movie make you grimace, or smile?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: No, I loved the flying fox. Those are the types of things I remember doing as a child.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes, me too.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I also appreciated the sense of space and freedom that the Dad provided his sons with.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Do you think the environment they were in contributed to that?  Is it harder to give our kids space and freedom in the city?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think that can be an added pressure on city dads. They hear the negative stuff in the media and they shy away from giving freedom out of their desire to protect their family.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Maybe, though not in our household, Immy has a lot more freedom and engages in a lot more &#8216;risky&#8217; behaviour with her Dad than she does when with me, obviously within the limits of her age but things like general proximity of parent to child and rough play, that type of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: My kids do engage in more adventurous behaviour in the backyard with Daddy too!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: You should see them at the pool, he bombies into the pool holding Immy, she loves it!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: As a kid I used to ride to the local milk bar, spend my pocket money on cheap lollies, ride back to the park, climb a tree and eat them. And Dad encouraged it! I&#8217;m not sure if my husband will encourage it in quite the same way, just because times have changed.  I guess we&#8217;ll see&#8230; I did learn to be quite responsible though. With freedom comes responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I am interested to know if the movie relate in any way to what Steve Biddulph shared in his presentation?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Steve Biddulph talks a lot about the stages of a boy&#8217;s development. From birth to around 5 he is all Mummy&#8217;s. Then he gets a surge of testosterone and becomes Daddy&#8217;s little shadow. This lasts right through to early teens, when he needs other male role models around. It was interesting watching the two sons in the two different phases.  Dads need to understand that the Mummy-phase will end, and they need to be ready for it!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I wonder how you will feel when the Mummy-phase ends! LOL! WIll you be ready for it?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I hope so&#8230; but it will be a learning curve for me too!  Understanding the physiology helps. I know that right now the kind of love I can give will set him up for life, but he needs the different kind of love his dad can give him too in order to be a balanced man (one day). I can&#8217;t imagine how hard it is for mums who have to handle the daddy-phase on their own, or dads who have to cope with the mummy-phase&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: If parenting teaches you anything, it is that everything always changes!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Too true, too true. So will you do anything differently, or view anything differently as a result of the flick?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I think it is all about balance. Balancing each role and recognising that both mother and father are equally important. And balancing expectations, there are times to relax and have fun but there is also much to be said for structure and routine.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Absolutely, I completely agree with you there.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: And have as much fun together as you can, that is what families should be about.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: It was a very real movie. It reminded me that life is fragile, and that we all need to enjoy each stage of our family life &#8211; as husbands and wives, as parents, as a whole family.</p>

		<p>I thought I&#8217;d revisit this old post from January, since it is featured in the current edition of Footprints Magazine.  You can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/inbox/?ref=mb#/pages/Footprints-magazine-for-Australian-Christian-women/105081061840">become a fan of Footprints on facebook</a> or <a href="http://footprintsaustralia.com/blog/">read their blog here</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1930" title="clean" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/clean.jpg" alt="clean" width="400" height="266" /></p>
<p>I had the most fabulous facial on the weekend. An hour to myself, uninterrupted by a needy baby or a demanding toddler. An hour of quiet bliss. I had not one, not two, but three exfoliations to get my skin glowing. As each mask was applied and then removed, I could almost feel the dirt, tiredness, stress and worry being lifted from my face. By the time it was over I looked better, felt better, and somehow sensed I was lighter than when I walked in.</p>
<p>My heart could sometimes use that kind of treatment. Like the pores on my skin, it&#8217;s easy for my heart to become clogged up too. Bitterness, cynicism, selfishness and jealousy sneak into my heart and weigh me down. They make me a duller version of the woman I know I can be.</p>
<p>Exfoliating my skin doesn&#8217;t come cheaply and takes a good hour, but exfoliating my heart only takes a few minutes. The Bible tells me that God can cleanse my heart, making it whiter than snow. (Psalm 51:7) All it takes it a genuine apology for the layers to be stripped away. And each time I do it I feel better, and brighter, and sense I am somehow lighter than before.</p>
<p>PS – thank you to that wonderful mum-friend who gave me the voucher for a facial as a birthday gift&#8230; everyone should have a friend like you.</p>

<p><em>&#8230;I often hear mothers who are pregnant the second time around say that they feel like no one has even noticed they are pregnant. I remember feeling exactly the same. My second pregnancy was no less special to me than my first. No less significant, or important or worthy of fuss. But it didn’t cause the same celebration and I found that hard to process&#8230;</em></p>

<p>Accidents can happen easily at those centres, so before I let my three year old loose on the equipment I pointed out a few hazards to her.  In particular, I cautioned her about hanging too long at the bottom of the speedy slides.</p>
<p>As it turned out, <em>she </em>was the one who crashed into another child at the slide&#8217;s end.   The other child wasn&#8217;t hurt, but went off in tears to find her mother as children do.  I reassured my daughter that it was just an accident, but that she needed to go and apologise.  I sent her off to the teary child and watched from a short distance with my one year old.  But as I observed my daughter&#8217;s body language, a sinking feeling came over me.  She wasn&#8217;t apologising &#8211; she was scolding the other child!!</p>
<p>My daughter went off to play and I sheepishly approached the other mum, who was suitably unimpressed and confirmed my suspicions.  My daughter had told the other child she shouldn&#8217;t have been stopped at the bottom of the slide and she had better watch out next time or she&#8217;d be crashed into again.  *Sigh*  I went to find my daughter, then marched her back to apologise properly.  I was cross at my daughter and embarrassed for myself.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t cross about the accident.  In a way I knew that I couldn&#8217;t be too cross at my child for what she had said either, because she had only repeated what I had modelled to her.  I was just cross that instead of admitting her own part in the accident she pointed the finger of blame at someone else.</p>
<p>My daughter was unusually quiet in the car on the way home.  I was so busy processing all of this that it was a while before I noticed she hadn&#8217;t said anything.  <em>Not a word</em>.  I caught her reflection in the rearview mirror and realised that she was processing too &#8211; and she felt bad about it.  For a moment I wished I could take away that feeling.  Guilt sits so heavily in the pit of your stomach.  But taking away that feeling wouldn&#8217;t do her any favours.  Her little moral compass is just beginning to develop.  So we talked about it a bit more, said a prayer about it, and then I encouraged her to let it go.</p>
<p>I want her to know that an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach usually means you&#8217;ve made a bad choice.  Perhaps as importantly, I want her to know that mistakes can be fixed, that we all live and learn, and that guilt doesn&#8217;t have to linger.</p>

</em></p>
<p><em>&#8230;But how do you say thank you without breaking the bank? Is the pricetag on the gift really a representation of how grateful you are? </em></p>
<p><em>In my years as a teacher I received many, many end of year gifts. Some cost a lot and some cost very little. The ones that I still have today are priceless. They are stuck into scrapbooks, safely stowed in the bottom of my bookcase. My priceless gifts? Page after page of letters and cards in childish scrawl, or from grateful parents, saying&#8230; </em><em>thank you Mrs O. </em></p>
<p>With that in mind, jump over to <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/370-dont-break-the-bank-to-say-thanks">Parenting Australia</a> for the rest of this post and my list of budget friendly thank you gift ideas.  Just remember to include a thank you note.  Do you have any other ideas to add&#8230;?  Feel free to comment here or over at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/370-dont-break-the-bank-to-say-thanks">Parenting Australia</a>.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s my blogaversary!!  One year ago, when I put up my very first post, there were a lot of things I didn&#8217;t know&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that blogging would give me back a sense of identity.  I was beginning to lose myself in the process of becoming a Mummy.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that there was such an amazing community of bloggers online.  In particular, Australia&#8217;s mummy bloggers are a tight knit, supportive, encouraging and REAL bunch of women.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that I would be embarking on such a seriously steep technical learning curve.  And I had no idea that twelve months down the track others would be asking ME for help and advice.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that it would be so time consuming!!  I certainly sleep less than I did before I became a blogger.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that it would grow my love of writing into a blossoming business and potential career.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that it would give me a teensy little window into my <a href="http://distractable.net/">husband</a>&#8216;s highly technical world, and bring us closer together (now we both stay up too late together, or take laptops to bed!)</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that in barely a year I&#8217;d put up 150 posts and receive over 1000 comments.  Wow.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d never run out of things to write about.</li>
<li>I didn&#8217;t know that I would {heart} blogging quite so much.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since it&#8217;s been a whole year, I&#8217;d love your feedback on my blog.  I&#8217;ve put together a quick survey with ten easy questions which will only take a couple of minutes to answer.  Would you mind&#8230;?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=riLZu6TqyUVGYukDxfLafA_3d_3d">Click Here to take survey</a></p>
<p>Thank you&#8230; and bless you heaps. xx</p>

<p style="text-align: left">Recently I joined two fellow blogging teacher-mamas, <a href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/">Christie from Childhood 101</a> and <a href="http://picklebums.com">Kate from Picklebums</a>, to discuss the topic of helicopter parenting.  According to <em>Wikipedia</em>, Helicopter parents are so named because, like helicopters, they hover closely overhead, rarely out of reach, whether their children need them or not&#8230;</p>
<p>You can read the full transcript at <a href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/">Childhood 101</a>, but here are a few snippets from the conversation.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m Cath &#8211; just in case you&#8217;ve forgotten my first name isn&#8217;t Squiggle&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *</p>
<div style="margin: 1ex">
<div style="text-align: left">Kate:  In terms of allowing children to take risks, I think we often over step the mark there.</p>
<p>Cath:  Most first time mums (me included) helicopter a little more than we ever thought we would!</p>
<p>Kate:  As an early childhood teacher you are forced to look at risk constantly. Child care centres are regulated so that no child is ever unsupervised and so that as much risk as possible is eliminated, it probably has to be that way in a children&#8217;s service setting.</p>
<p>Christie:  I do too, Cath, and I cannot understand how we are so adverse to letting our children do what we did as children? I walked to school, I climbed (and fell out of) trees, I rode my bike in the street.</p>
<p>Cath:  I have relaxed more with my second child but I find it hard to find a balance between my teacher training (eagle eyes on playground duty) and my desire to let my kids learn by exploring, falling, and getting up again.</p>
<p>Kate:  I am a worrier so I am prone to over thinking the risks but I try really hard to realise that and step back from it. I often say, &#8216;What&#8217;s the worst that can happen?&#8217;</p>
<p>Cath:  Yes, I have to make that conscious decision too, Kate.</p>
<p>Kate:  I think it&#8217;s natural that parents are fearful for their children&#8230; if your biggest fear as a parent wasn&#8217;t the loss of your child you&#8217;d wouldn&#8217;t be a good parent …but not letting that get the better of you is important.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: center">*   *   *</div>
<div style="text-align: left">Cath:  You know when I find myself hovering the most?  At playgrounds. Especially busy ones with lots of kids and lots of mums around.</p>
<p>Kate:  I usually hover at playgrounds for social reasons rather than physical risk reasons.</p>
<p>Cath:  I&#8217;m not quite sure why I hover&#8230; a mix of reasons I think.</p>
<p>Kate:  I feel confident that my kids all know their physical limits better than I do, even the small one who tries to follow his big sisters will stop when he realises he is high enough.</p>
<p>Cath:  LOL Kate&#8230; mine is more likely to climb to the moon and not realise how high she is!</p>
<p>Kate:  My small one climbs like a monkey but he&#8217;s very good at it.. and so far only one set of stitches and that was from falling off a low chair!</p></div>
<div style="text-align: center">*   *   *</div>
<div style="text-align: left">Christie:  How do you deal with other parents who don&#8217;t step in, especially if their child is being a bit rough?</p>
<p>Cath:  I encourage my own child to respond with, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t do x&#8230; I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate:  I do the same, Cath, if my children need me to, I&#8217;ll give them the words to use to make sure their feelings are known.</p>
<p>Christie: As a teacher of 2-5 year olds I always taught the children to say &#8220;Stop&#8221; in a loud voice, to empower them and the loud voice helps to attract adult attention (so the adult can come and help the children resolve the situation).  Most two year olds can say &#8220;Stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate:  We use the same phrase, &#8216;Stop &#8211; I don&#8217;t like that&#8217;</p>
<p>Christie:  And then obviously older children can say, &#8220;Stop, I don&#8217;t like it when you &#8230;&#8221; and give more of an explanation.</p>
<p>Cath:  I think right there we are preparing ourselves, and our kids, to move away from us little by little.</p>
<p>Christie:  It is about equipping them so that we feel we can step away.</p>
<p>Cath:  Exactly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>What about you?  Do you struggle with letting go of your kids?  Are you more guilty of hovering than you expected you&#8217;d be?  Feel free to share your thoughts on helicopter parenting here or on Christie or Kate&#8217;s blogs.</strong></p>

		<p>When I was a little girl I loved watching my mum dress up.  I still remember watching her paint her nails and smelling her perfume.  Now that I&#8217;m a mum with a daughter of my own, the cycle goes on.  Last week I dressed up for a hats and heels morning tea with my <a href="http://mops.org.au">MOPS</a> group.</p>
<p>My three year old&#8217;s eyes were wide as she surveyed my red toenails, and tried on my shoes.  But oh the look on her face when I added a feathery fascinator to my outfit!  &#8220;Mummy, please can I wear feathers too?&#8221;  How could I say no?!!  We found some pink and purple feathers in the craft box and I tucked them into her ponytail.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1781" title="IMG_8412" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_8412-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_8412" width="225" height="300" /> <img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1782" title="IMG_8376" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_8376-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_8376" width="225" height="300" /></p>
<p>If you ask me, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with little girls wanting to &#8220;play ladies&#8221; every now and then.  It&#8217;s good for their self esteem and helps them start to develop their own sense of style.  I&#8217;m happy for my daughter to try on my shoes and accessories.  At home.  In a healthy, play kind of way.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m not happy about is the play becoming real too early.  As I watched my three year old clomp around in my heels I was reminded of another little three year old I&#8217;ve seen around the place lately.  Suri Cruise has been all over the glossies recently as a little fashionista complete with peeptoes and a latte cup.  <a href="http://girlwithasatchel.blogspot.com/2009/10/mags-is-this-ok.html">Girl With A Satchel</a> shared her thoughts on the issue last week from a journalist&#8217;s perspective (check out her post for the cover pic I&#8217;m talking about).  I thought it was worth sharing my thoughts here from a mothering perspective.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t we want our little girls to stay little girls for as long as possible?  Three is still very, very young.  We&#8217;re talking about children who haven&#8217;t even started school yet.  In my opinion as a mother and primary school teacher, here is what I <em>personally </em>think is ok for little girls:</p>
<ul>
<li>playing with dress ups &#8211; male and female clothes and accessories <img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1783" title="IMG_8346" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_8346-150x150.jpg" alt="IMG_8346" width="150" height="150" /></li>
<li>playing ladies with Mummy or an Aunty &#8211; carefully trying on beads and shoes just for a little turn</li>
<li>wearing nice clothes for nice occasions and round-the-house clothes for play</li>
<li>wearing practical shoes that support little feet and growing bodies</li>
<li>having a no-colour lip balm for special days</li>
<li>having special hair clips and ribbons &#8211; this is age appropriate bling!</li>
<li>having a milkshake when Mum has a latte</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, I can&#8217;t tell you what&#8217;s right for you as you raise your daughter.  I can only share my own opinion.  But can I encourage you to think about where you will draw the line with your little girl?  Otherwise we will all have &#8220;teenagers&#8221; on our hands long before they reach puberty, and we just might miss out on one of the loveliest stages of raising daughters.</p>

<p>Meet Rochelle Manners, mother of two gorgeous kids Julian and CoCo.  Rochelle started <a href="http://www.wombatbooks.com.au">Wombat Books</a> after self publishing her first book, and now publishes others under the <a href="http://www.mostlyformothers.com/">Mostly for Mothers</a> (for mums) and <a href="http://www.evenbeforepublishing.com/">Even Before</a> (for Christians) imprints.  Her latest anthology, <em>Even Before You Were Born</em> is a lovely collection of reflections on pregnancy and birth.  Ok, so I&#8217;m biased because I have two stories in the anthology!  The anthology will be launched next month and you will be able to buy signed copies here if you&#8217;re interested.</p>
<p>Here are Rochelle&#8217;s five faves, and her biggest struggle as she juggles motherhood and publishing:</p>
<p><strong>1.  Favourite outing with your children</strong> &#8211; Visiting my mum and dads (the kids’ nanna and grandad’s) house. They have a huge yard, a trampoline and a pool we are looking forward to using in summer. Plus different and exciting toys and it is always a day trip as it is a bit of a drive.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with your children</strong> &#8211; My favourite or the kids?! I like drawing shapes and letters and trying to help him recognise them, but Julian’s attention span doesn’t last too long and he asks me to draw cars instead! So instead we end up playing cars (which baby CoCo likes doing too). I also like it now that CoCo is getting old enough to be fun to play with for Julian and they chase each other around the house (both crawling).</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal </strong>- Generally anything easy, but probably is Macaroni Chicken (sort of a pasta bake but nicer and using chicken and a chicken soup as a sauce).</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime story/stories</strong> &#8211; My son likes all the stories where the animals or characters fall down, cry or yawn so it is pretty amusing when he asks for the “crying” books.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down!</strong> &#8211; Catch up on work – ie my laptop is an addiction! I give myself too much to do, but I guess I enjoy it. Watching TV at the same time is fun too.</p>
<p><strong>6.  Finally, what&#8217;s your biggest struggle as a mum?</strong> &#8211; My biggest struggle is probably balancing it all – work, homelife and the kids – and making sure I don’t feel guilty by ensuring I spend enough time with the kids and keep up with  my responsibilities. I am still learning, but am also fairly efficient at getting work done. It seems like there is always more to do and the kids really are patient when I work. Balancing and making it so I need to work less and can spend more time the kids is definitely worthwhile. (I am going to <a href="http://www.mostlyformothers.com/workingandmothering.html">start on a book about that</a> soon.)</p>

<p>Everybody&#8217;s talking about it&#8230; this issue with keeping up the juggling act.  We&#8217;re all talking about it because we&#8217;re all struggling with it.  How do we keep all the balls in the air?  How do we juggle life as women, mothers, wives, employers, employees, bloggers&#8230;</p>
<p>Each of us is only one person, and there are only 24 hours in a day.  At the <em><strong>bare </strong></em>minimum we need to sleep for six of those hours (and you and I both know that eight would be better)!  Without stopping to eat we&#8217;d never get through the day, so there go another two hours.  With the hours left there are so many demands on our time.  I spend a lot of time with a lot of mums who confess that they often crash into bed at night, wondering how they&#8217;ll fit all the things they didn&#8217;t get around to doing today, into tomorrow&#8217;s schedule!  And I understand, because I&#8217;m as guilty of it as anyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://picklebums.com/2009/09/20/tricky/">Kate from Picklebums</a> recently wrote about this <a href="http://picklebums.com/2009/09/20/tricky/">Tricky</a> problem, and in the same week a friend and MOPS (<a href="http://mops.org.au">Mothers Of Pre Schoolers</a>) leader posted this on facebook:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1740" title="juggling_karen" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/juggling_karen.png" alt="juggling_karen" width="553" height="59" /></p>
<p>As you can imagine she received many comments.  I started writing my list for you, but deleted it because quite frankly I&#8217;m embarrassed about how long it is.  Another mum from my church who has older kids than I do and is a little further along the road than me pointed me to this article by <a href="http://www.keriwyattkent.com/articles/greenmarkers.htm">Keri Wyatt Kent</a>.  In it she says,</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;font-size: x-small"><em>A wise friend of mine puts it this way:<br />
“I picture myself juggling a lot of balls. Sometimes, I                          drop a ball. In most cases, that’s not too big of a                          deal. But a few of the balls, like my husband and my                          kids, are glass balls. So I make sure I do whatever it                          takes not to shatter those balls.”</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Some of the balls are rubber, and will bounce if we just                          give them a little push now and then. Some are lead and                          just weigh us down and we shouldn’t be trying to juggle                          them in the first place.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sometimes we have to say “no” to opportunities, to                          requests that other people make. The discipline of                          saying no, and wisdom to know when to say it, is a great                          challenge. </em></strong></p>
<p>When I read that I thought she was speaking to me.  My blog is a rubber ball.  It can bounce back from a few days offline, and nobody&#8217;s world would be shattered if I didn&#8217;t post for a month.  I think housework is a rubber ball too!  I know there are balls made of lead I need to just let go of.  They are not mine to juggle.  But my husband and my kids are my glass balls.  I can&#8217;t drop them.  Ever.  My precious kids need Mummy-time almost as much as they need food to eat, and my husband deserves the best of me, not what&#8217;s left of me at 11:30pm. I&#8217;m so glad I have this visual image now to remind me of the beauty and fragility of relationships.</p>
<p>What are you juggling in your life?</p>
<p>PS &#8211; No judgemental comments.  Especially about the 6hrs sleep thing, ok?  We&#8217;re all just doing our best and trying to work things out&#8230;</p>
