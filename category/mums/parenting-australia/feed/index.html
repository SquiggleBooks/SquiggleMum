<p>For those of you interested in what I&#8217;ve been writing about for mums and dads around Australia, here is a wrapup of my <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au">Parenting Australia</a> posts for June.  My favourite for the month is <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/661-pre-reading-foundations">Pre Reading Foundations</a>, a post about why we should NOT teach children to read before they are ready, but instead invest in their prereading skills.  This post attracted a bit of attention!  Click the link on each post to read more.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/670-sales-and-celebrations">Sales and Celebrations</a></strong> &#8211; It seems the thing to say at the moment is “Happy EOFYS!”  I don’t know  about you, but something doesn’t sit right with me as we “celebrate” the  end of financial year.  I should be upfront and admit that I like a  good sale.  Actually, I LOVE a good sale and I hardly ever pay full  price for anything.  I like to make sure my dollar goes as far as it  can, and I am not a frivolous spender by any stretch!  Yes, I have been  to the stocktake sales.  Yes, I have made purchases.  Yes, I have bought  presents ahead of time while they are at reduced prices.  Yes, I have  bought children’s clothes a size ahead for when they need them.  But no –  I have not bought things unnecessarily simply because they are  reduced.  No, I have not spun into a sale-induced frenzy.  And no, I  don’t think sale season is, to quote a current tv ad, “the best time of  the year.”</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/661-pre-reading-foundations">Pre Reading Foundations</a></strong> &#8211; Reading is a complicated process, and there’s an incredible amount of  foundational work required before any formal teaching begins.  The  stronger the foundations, the more solid the building will be.  Parents  who rush to give their kids a “head start” without doing the ground work  often do more harm than good.  <strong>Wise parents invest in the  foundations instead, and do not push young kids to read before they are  ready.</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/656-how-crunchy-are-you">How Crunchy Are You?</a></strong> &#8211; The first time I heard the phrase  “crunchy parenting” I had to google it.  (It’s a good thing I  read a lot of blogs.  How else would I keep up with all the current  buzz words?)  In a basic sense the term crunchy is interchangeable with  alternative.  But as more and more parents move away from mainstream  ideas, and as more alternative ideas become widely accepted – things  aren’t clear cut as they once were!</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/650-never-say-never">Never Say Never</a></strong> &#8211; If I could only give you one piece of advice for surviving with a  newborn it would be this: never say never.  It’s impossible to go into parenting  without some pre conceived ideas.  The media show us images of  motherhood in parenting mags, glossies, tv ads and even in Holly wood  blockbusters.  And while we all know those images are sugar coated (and  probably airbrushed too) they still contribute to our picture of early  parenting.  On the other hand, real life examples of mothering can come  crashing in on our picture.  We’ve all been guilty of judging a mother,  whether a relative, friend or stranger, without having any clue about  life with kids.  It’s hard not to think about how we would respond in the  same situation, and it’s funny how often we assume we’d do it better.   Which of course leads to dangerous “I’d never&#8230;” thinking.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/643-preparing-for-needles">Preparing For Needles</a></strong> &#8211; I must admit that I’m not looking forward to tomorrow.  My  just-turned-four year old has an appointment with our GP for her  immunisations.  I’m relieved in a way, because it will be the last of  the standard childhood injections.  I’m also a little nervous though,  because she’s such a big girl now and she understands exactly what is  going on.  Babies and young toddlers can be held down for their needles.   Holding down a four year old isn’t so easy and other strategies are  required.  Without making too much of a fuss about it all, I hope I have  prepared my girl with a few simple steps.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re interested in what I&#8217;ve been sharing over at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au">Parenting Australia</a>, here is a wrap up of my posts for May.  I think my favourite post for the month is <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/611-sick-kids-and-sleepless-nights">Sick Kids and Sleepless Nights</a>.  That article reminds me not to judge other mums, and helps me to remember that everything is a matter of perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/PAbanner.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3016" title="PAbanner" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/PAbanner.jpg" alt="" width="510" height="63" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/630-supporting-new-mums">Supporting New Mums</a> &#8211; Having been through pregnancy and birth twice, I’ve been on the  receiving end of some wonderful gifts and thoughtful offers of help.  I  almost wish I could go back to my pre-baby days and do things  differently for my friends who had children before me!  Until you’ve  been through the experience it’s hard to know what to do and how to  help.  So here are my suggestions for supporting pregnant friends, or  those who have recently given birth&#8230; <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/630-supporting-new-mums"><em>click here to read more</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/619-staying-sane-with-a-reflux-bub">Staying Sane With A Reflux Bub</a> &#8211; Both of my children suffered with reflux  to varying degrees.  My daughter was a back arching, screaming little  chucker.  I spent weeks pacing the floor with her in my arms, her little  head thrown back while I sang every nursery rhyme I knew in an attempt  to calm her, or drown out the screaming, or both. Unfortunately  having one child with reflux doesn’t mean you will be exempt the next  time around!  <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/619-staying-sane-with-a-reflux-bub"><em>click here to read more</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/611-sick-kids-and-sleepless-nights">Sick Kids and Sleepless Nights</a> &#8211; I’ve only had a few hours sleep and I’m so tired I can barely see the  screen this morning.  I don’t have a newborn, and I didn’t stay up too  late last night.  It’s just that the kids are sick.  It’s nothing major –  just one of those winter bugs that is par for the course as the cooler  weather sets in.  But it only takes a minor illness to upset things&#8230; <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/611-sick-kids-and-sleepless-nights"><em>click here to read more</em></a></p>
<p><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/600-my-first-mothers-day">My First Mother&#8217;s Day</a> &#8211; As my favourite day of the year approaches, I can’t help but think back  to my very first Mother’s Day four years ago&#8230; <strong>My first Mother’s Day was a complete non-event.</strong> Nobody let me down.  My hubby didn’t forget.  My daughter didn’t do  anything wrong.  It’s just that she hadn’t arrived!  I was due about  five days before Mother’s Day, and was looking forward to celebrating my  first one with a newborn in my arms.  I really, honestly thought that I  would be a Mummy by then&#8230; <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/600-my-first-mothers-day"><em>click here to read more</em></a></p>

<p style="text-align: left">Instead of letting you know each week when I&#8217;ve posted over at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au">Parenting Australia</a>, I thought I&#8217;d start doing a wrapup at the end of each month.  Feel free to jump over to any posts that are of interest to you!  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve been writing about lately&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/579-the-trouble-with-teeth">The Trouble With Teeth</a> &#8211; &#8220;Both of my kids have been late teethers, and didn’t cut their first  tooth until close to one.  At 18mths now my son has his eight front  teeth (four top and four bottom) and is in the process of cutting his  molars.  Ugh.  The dribble is always the first giveaway that new teeth  are on the way.  Drool on his shirts, great slobbery patches on the cot  sheets, and a dribble rash on his chin.  Even his teddy smells like  slobber!&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/583-ruling-out-fussiness">Ruling Out Fussiness</a> &#8211; &#8220;I was brought up to eat everything on  my plate.  If you couldn’t finish your dinner there was no way you could  even think about dessert.  There were no special meals for any member  of the family.  We all at the same thing and we all ate together.  In many ways this has served me  well&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/589-standing-tall-on-anzac-day">Standing Tall On ANZAC Day</a> &#8211; &#8220;I grew up as an Army kid, and proud of it.  I remember climbing trees in  the barracks while the dads all served the mums on Mother’s Day in the  mess.  I have fond memories of Santa visiting at Christmas time in a  tank full of pressies for the kids.  I remember feeling an immense sense  of pride when I heard my father call his men to attention on the parade  ground, and watching them respond to his commands with, well, military  precision.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/594-outsmarting-toddlers">Outsmarting Toddlers</a> &#8211; &#8220;Toddlers are smart.  Very smart.  I’m  always amazed at how much they learn between the ages of eighteen months  and three.  It’s as if they grow into their little bodies as well as  their minds.  And it pretty much takes all of their toddler years to  work out how to use their newfound physical and mental energy for good  and not for evil!  (Ok, that’s a little strong but you get my drift.)  Here are three of the most common  toddler tactics and how to combat them.&#8221;</p>
<p>PS &#8211; so do you like the new look for the blog??</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/anzac.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2873" title="anzac" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/anzac.jpg" alt="" width="403" height="302" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/589-standing-tall-on-anzac-day">Parenting Australia</a> this week the topic is ANZAC Day, and as an Army kid this is a topic close to my heart.  I&#8217;ve written a very personal account and would love you to jump over and read it.  Here&#8217;s a snippet:</p>
<p><em><strong>I stand tall on ANZAC Day.  It’s a big  deal in my family.  Not only were two of my great grandfathers ANZACS  themselves, but my own <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/218-let-dads-be-dads">Father</a> served in the Australian Defence Force for twenty years.  I grew up  as an Army kid, and proud of it.  I remember climbing trees in the  barracks while the dads all served the mums on Mother’s Day in the  mess.  I have fond memories of Santa visiting at Christmas time in a  tank full of pressies for the kids.  I remember feeling an immense sense  of pride when I heard my father call his men to attention on the parade  ground, and watching them respond to his commands with, well, military  precision.  Of course being an Army family  also had its challenges&#8230; (<a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/589-standing-tall-on-anzac-day">click here to read more</a>)</strong><br />
</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m interested in how other families approach ANZAC Day.  What will you be doing for the long weekend?  Will you go to a service with your family?  Bake ANZAC bickies?  Do you talk to your kids about the tragedy of war?  Focus on heroes of the past?  Or do you talk about your hopes for the future?  You can comment here or at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/589-standing-tall-on-anzac-day">Parenting Australia</a>.</p>

<p>I love writing posts for my own blog here at SquiggleMum, but the blogosphere is a <strong>community </strong>and I also contribute elsewhere as much as I am able.  Community is about giving and not just getting.  Community is about belonging, supporting, encouraging, and coming along side.  (The pics above are of me meeting up with many members of the online community.  Still so many I&#8217;d love to meet, especially over there in the west!!)</p>
<p>This week I seem to be everywhere other than on my own blog &#8211; but that&#8217;s ok, because I&#8217;m out in the wonderful community of online Aussie mamas.  Here&#8217;s where you can find me this week.  I&#8217;d love you to come and be part of the community too by leaving a comment on these posts.</p>

<li><a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au">Parenting Australia</a> &#8211; I&#8217;d really love your comments on this week&#8217;s post about setting boundaries with kids, especially boys!  It&#8217;s called <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/540-catherene-blog">Letting Go of No.</a> I&#8217;ve always been firm with boundaries, but I&#8217;m starting to wonder if I need to relax a little with my son.  Any mamas out there with boys older than mine (17mths) like to share their thoughts?  Oh, and if you missed my Parenting Australia post last week on allergies, it&#8217;s <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/533-allergy-aware">here</a>.  I interviewed my beautiful friend Beck who deals with her son&#8217;s allergies on a daily basis.</li>

<p style="text-align: left">A couple of weeks ago the <a href="http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/196/2/126">results of a ten year Australian study</a> were released, refuting once and for all the notion of <em>Mummy Brain</em>.  But I say the phrase will stick around, because most of us know that our forgetful and even irrational behaviour following the birth of a baby has nothing to do with brain changes and <strong>everything to do with sleep deprivation. </strong>Duh.</p>
<p><em>Saying you have &#8220;mummy-brain&#8221; is coded language for I-can’t-sleep-I-can’t-concentrate-I’m-struggling-don’t-judge-me.  That’s quite a mouthful, huh?  Mummy-brain is much easier to say, and is well understood by other mothers.  We cut each other slack when we hear that phrase, for good reason&#8230;</em></p>
<p>Jump over to <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/522-seriously-sleep-deprived">Parenting Australia</a> for the rest of the article.  Do you think the term &#8220;mummy brain&#8221; will stick around?</p>
<p>(PS &#8211; pic is of me just home from hospital following my son&#8217;s birth in 2008, seriously sleep deprived!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m having a bit of a rant over at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/518-teeny-agers">Parenting Australia</a> this week regarding fashion for young girls.  I didn&#8217;t mean to get up on my soap box, but I feel so strongly about some of the clothes that we are &#8220;supposed&#8221; to be dressing our kids in and the messages we are giving them.</p>
<p><em><strong>When did we decide to skip childhood and fast track our babes from tots to teens?</strong> This week’s junk mail catalogues are sitting beside me as I type.  Maybe at 31 I’m getting old (??), but this is what I see.  I see pages of little girls dressed in sequins, studs and chains.  I see short shorts and short skirts.  I see leggings under some of those short garments so we can pretend they’re not as short as they really are.  I see knee high boots with leopard print leggings.  And I see slogans that range from arrogant to inappropriate.  <strong>Three year olds need clothes for cubbies, not for clubbing! </strong></em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love your thoughts on this topic, either here or over on the original post.  I&#8217;ve already had a lovely journalist from <a href="http://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/new-idea/">New Idea</a> on the phone this morning interviewing me on the subject so it&#8217;s obviously a hot topic right now&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s funny.  I&#8217;ve had two kids but I have no idea what it&#8217;s like to go into labour!  Not naturally anyway.  With both pregnancies I had to be induced at 41 weeks.  You can read the story of my two overdue arrivals at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/500-overdue-times-two">Parenting Australia </a>this week.  Here&#8217;s a teaser&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Most of us spend a considerable amount of time during pregnancy thinking about labour. First we dream about it, then we think more seriously about it, then we panic about it, then we realise there’s no going back so we’d best come to terms with it!  I imagined my waters breaking. Or I imagined waking my husband in the middle of the night saying, “This is it Honey&#8230;” I imagined timing contractions and working out when would be best to head to the hospital.  Instead, we calmly packed my bag into the car and drove without a sense of urgency. I waddled into the maternity ward, stopping and smiling for a photo on the way. We checked in at reception and then sat in a waiting room for a couple of hours before being settled into a bed. Prostaglandin gel was applied and my husband was sent home to get some sleep. I lay there, wide awake, alone, wondering if labour would start. Not at all what I imagined.</em></p>
<p>Jump over to <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/500-overdue-times-two">Parenting Australia</a> for the rest of my story.  Anyone else out there had a similar overdue experience??</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What kind of mum are you?  A SAHM?  A WAHM?  A Working Mum?  Or like me, are you an in-between mum, falling into a grey space between those titles&#8230;?  I&#8217;m sharing my thoughts on the topic over at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/493-in-between-mums">Parenting Australia</a> today.  Here&#8217;s a snippet:</p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000">I loved teaching, but resigning was the right thing for me to do when my daughter was born in 2006 as I knew I wanted to be at home with her full time.  Over the next twelve months the majority of my mum-friends slowly returned to work, but I was happy with my choice.  Mostly!  Two and a half years later we added a baby boy to our family.  And I’m still home full time.  Well, kind of.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Here&#8217;s the link to the article I wrote last week too if you&#8217;re interested, <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/488-tips-from-a-lunch-box-spy">Tips From A Lunchbox Spy</a>.  I hope those of you who have school aged kids are getting back into the swing of packing lunchboxes and school bags again!!</span></p>
