		<description><![CDATA[Watching the axe in that child's hand made me think about the risks we do, and more often than not don't, allow our children to take.  ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In reflecting on our lovely day at the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/the-local-show/">local show</a>, one thing has really stayed with me.</p>
<p>The highlight of the show this year for me was the woodchopping.  Up  there with the big blokes (and ladies!) was a little tyke the tender age of 5.  He  stood on his block like the others, one foot on either end of the wood,  and chopped right through between his feet.  I couldn&#8217;t help but notice  how sharp and shiny his axe was as he swung it up into the air, and back  down into the wood again and again.  It took him a long time, but the crowd were right behind him and let up a cheer when he finally split that log in two.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/axe1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-3670 aligncenter" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/axe1.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="315" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">
<p>Watching the axe in that child&#8217;s hand made me think about the risks we do, and more often than not <em>don&#8217;t</em>, allow our children to take.  This child was obviously very capable.  He had been taught by someone who knew what they were doing, and he had the right tool in his hands.  I&#8217;m not saying that we should all rush out and buy our kids axes, but I am saying that we often underestimate what our children are capable of, given the right training and tools.</p>
<p><strong>How often as parents and educators do we insist on only putting safety scissors into a child&#8217;s hands for fear of him cutting himself, when he is actually capable of wielding an axe?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/scissors_plastic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3671" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/scissors_plastic.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="315" /></a><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Always, always we have a duty of care</strong> when we work with children, but this should not mean we eliminate all risk.  To read more from other educators who believe in making things &#8220;<em>as safe as necessary, rather than as safe as possible</em>&#8221; check out these bloggers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://teachertomsblog.blogspot.com/">Teacher Tom</a> in the US</li>
<li>Juliet from <a href="http://creativestarlearning.blogspot.com/">I&#8217;m A Teacher &#8211; Get Me OUTSIDE here!</a> (Creative Star Learning) in the UK</li>
<li>Jenny from <a href="http://progressiveearlychildhoodeducation.blogspot.com/">Let The Children Play</a> in Australia</li>
<li>Donna and Sherry from <a href="http://www.playbasedlearning.com.au/">Irresistible Ideas for Play Based Learning</a> also Australia</li>
</ul>
<p>These educators <strong>allow reasonable risk</strong> and encourage their young students to climb, construct, get wet, get dirty and use all manner of tools including hot glue guns, saws, hammers and more.  In doing so they encourage the students to assess risk for themselves, to learn about consequences, and to discover what their bodies can and cannot do.</p>
<p>Do  you allow  your children to take reasonable risks?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>The Boys Are Back</em> is a beautiful film shot in South Australia, starring Clive Owen and directed by Scott Hicks, director of Shine.  Inspired by a true story, it is the touching tale of a father who finds himself raising two sons alone while grieving the loss of his wife.  As he transitions from part time parent to full on father he learns a lot about his children, and perhaps even more about himself.</p>
<p>Would you like a night out at the movies?  I can&#8217;t organise baby sitting for you, but I do have TEN DOUBLE PASSES to giveaway thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/HopscotchFilms">Hopscotch Films</a>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The first ten SquiggleMum subscribers (new or existing, by email or RSS) to leave a comment below will win.<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>Hopscotch were also kind enough to send Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/">Childhood 101</a> and I tickets to catch the flick, and while we saw the film on opposite sides of the country we enjoyed chatting about it online.  Here are some of our thoughts reflecting on the film:</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: So was it what you expected?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I really enjoyed the fact that the movie explored parenting from a male perspective and the relationship between Dads and sons.  Though obviously it is just one perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I enjoyed the Dad and boys perspective too. Especially in the light of having recently heard Steve Biddulph speak on raising boys, and the importance of the relationship between fathers and sons.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I found it really poignant when the Dad told his mother-in-law that his young son didn&#8217;t really know him, that they needed time to get to know each other and how to relate to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes, it made me wonder how many fathers would have to &#8220;get to know&#8221; their sons in the same situation.  And also made me wonder as a mum how I can facilitate my husband &#8220;knowing&#8221; my kids right now&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I think men generally relate differently to their children, and I think this generation of fathers especially have had a whole new set of expectations place upon them.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think this generation of fathers genuinely want to be Dads, want to spend time with their kids and want to be involved &#8211; but making it happen is hard.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: And society keeps pushing all of us to work longer and harder as members of the workforce which does not facilitate better family relationships in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: That was really highlighted in the movie: a dad pushed so hard at work that he chose to leave his kids overnight to save face with his employer.  No dad wants to be in that position.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Though wasn&#8217;t the older boy sweet and brave to offer to stay? I really felt for him when it all fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes &#8211; sweet and brave.  I hope I raise a boy who is sweet and brave, even if he doesn&#8217;t always get things right.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: So, how do we support our husbands to help them have the time and opportunity to be involved?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think we have to take a step back sometimes. As mums we can be control freaks!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: That is very true.  I think it is important for a child to have time one on one with each parent, as well as time together as a whole family.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I agree.  And while I absolutely think that parenting works best when both parents are on the same page, I think mums need to let dads do things their way without us criticising.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I also believe, it is about that being time truly being together too, not just watching the TV or doing chores around the home but having fun, laughing together, getting out and sharing unique experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Getting the most out of whatever time you have together.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: That is right, creating memories with children.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: But I have to say&#8230; if the memory making involves dad driving on the beach with a child on the bonnet of the car, I&#8217;d probably step in there!! LOL</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Well, sometimes what Mum doesn&#8217;t know can&#8217;t hurt her! LOL!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: There was a scene in the movie where the kid was bomb diving into the spa bath. That was a memory making moment I would have missed as a mum, because I would have stepped in too soon, and worried about the mess.  Maybe sometimes a memory is worth the mess??</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I don&#8217;t think it was the mess that worried me, it was the chance of him hurting himself that had me grimacing!  But then, I am pretty tolerant of mess!  Fun mess, not domestic mess!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Did the flying fox in the movie make you grimace, or smile?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: No, I loved the flying fox. Those are the types of things I remember doing as a child.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes, me too.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I also appreciated the sense of space and freedom that the Dad provided his sons with.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Do you think the environment they were in contributed to that?  Is it harder to give our kids space and freedom in the city?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think that can be an added pressure on city dads. They hear the negative stuff in the media and they shy away from giving freedom out of their desire to protect their family.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Maybe, though not in our household, Immy has a lot more freedom and engages in a lot more &#8216;risky&#8217; behaviour with her Dad than she does when with me, obviously within the limits of her age but things like general proximity of parent to child and rough play, that type of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: My kids do engage in more adventurous behaviour in the backyard with Daddy too!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: You should see them at the pool, he bombies into the pool holding Immy, she loves it!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: As a kid I used to ride to the local milk bar, spend my pocket money on cheap lollies, ride back to the park, climb a tree and eat them. And Dad encouraged it! I&#8217;m not sure if my husband will encourage it in quite the same way, just because times have changed.  I guess we&#8217;ll see&#8230; I did learn to be quite responsible though. With freedom comes responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I am interested to know if the movie relate in any way to what Steve Biddulph shared in his presentation?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Steve Biddulph talks a lot about the stages of a boy&#8217;s development. From birth to around 5 he is all Mummy&#8217;s. Then he gets a surge of testosterone and becomes Daddy&#8217;s little shadow. This lasts right through to early teens, when he needs other male role models around. It was interesting watching the two sons in the two different phases.  Dads need to understand that the Mummy-phase will end, and they need to be ready for it!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I wonder how you will feel when the Mummy-phase ends! LOL! WIll you be ready for it?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I hope so&#8230; but it will be a learning curve for me too!  Understanding the physiology helps. I know that right now the kind of love I can give will set him up for life, but he needs the different kind of love his dad can give him too in order to be a balanced man (one day). I can&#8217;t imagine how hard it is for mums who have to handle the daddy-phase on their own, or dads who have to cope with the mummy-phase&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: If parenting teaches you anything, it is that everything always changes!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Too true, too true. So will you do anything differently, or view anything differently as a result of the flick?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I think it is all about balance. Balancing each role and recognising that both mother and father are equally important. And balancing expectations, there are times to relax and have fun but there is also much to be said for structure and routine.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Absolutely, I completely agree with you there.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: And have as much fun together as you can, that is what families should be about.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: It was a very real movie. It reminded me that life is fragile, and that we all need to enjoy each stage of our family life &#8211; as husbands and wives, as parents, as a whole family.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1808 aligncenter" title="helicopter" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/helicopter-300x199.jpg" alt="helicopter" width="300" height="199" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Recently I joined two fellow blogging teacher-mamas, <a href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/">Christie from Childhood 101</a> and <a href="http://picklebums.com">Kate from Picklebums</a>, to discuss the topic of helicopter parenting.  According to <em>Wikipedia</em>, Helicopter parents are so named because, like helicopters, they hover closely overhead, rarely out of reach, whether their children need them or not&#8230;</p>
<p>You can read the full transcript at <a href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/">Childhood 101</a>, but here are a few snippets from the conversation.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m Cath &#8211; just in case you&#8217;ve forgotten my first name isn&#8217;t Squiggle&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *</p>
<div style="margin: 1ex">
<div style="text-align: left">Kate:  In terms of allowing children to take risks, I think we often over step the mark there.</p>
<p>Cath:  Most first time mums (me included) helicopter a little more than we ever thought we would!</p>
<p>Kate:  As an early childhood teacher you are forced to look at risk constantly. Child care centres are regulated so that no child is ever unsupervised and so that as much risk as possible is eliminated, it probably has to be that way in a children&#8217;s service setting.</p>
<p>Christie:  I do too, Cath, and I cannot understand how we are so adverse to letting our children do what we did as children? I walked to school, I climbed (and fell out of) trees, I rode my bike in the street.</p>
<p>Cath:  I have relaxed more with my second child but I find it hard to find a balance between my teacher training (eagle eyes on playground duty) and my desire to let my kids learn by exploring, falling, and getting up again.</p>
<p>Kate:  I am a worrier so I am prone to over thinking the risks but I try really hard to realise that and step back from it. I often say, &#8216;What&#8217;s the worst that can happen?&#8217;</p>
<p>Cath:  Yes, I have to make that conscious decision too, Kate.</p>
<p>Kate:  I think it&#8217;s natural that parents are fearful for their children&#8230; if your biggest fear as a parent wasn&#8217;t the loss of your child you&#8217;d wouldn&#8217;t be a good parent …but not letting that get the better of you is important.</p></div>
<div style="text-align: center">*   *   *</div>
<div style="text-align: left">Cath:  You know when I find myself hovering the most?  At playgrounds. Especially busy ones with lots of kids and lots of mums around.</p>
<p>Kate:  I usually hover at playgrounds for social reasons rather than physical risk reasons.</p>
<p>Cath:  I&#8217;m not quite sure why I hover&#8230; a mix of reasons I think.</p>
<p>Kate:  I feel confident that my kids all know their physical limits better than I do, even the small one who tries to follow his big sisters will stop when he realises he is high enough.</p>
<p>Cath:  LOL Kate&#8230; mine is more likely to climb to the moon and not realise how high she is!</p>
<p>Kate:  My small one climbs like a monkey but he&#8217;s very good at it.. and so far only one set of stitches and that was from falling off a low chair!</p></div>
<div style="text-align: center">*   *   *</div>
<div style="text-align: left">Christie:  How do you deal with other parents who don&#8217;t step in, especially if their child is being a bit rough?</p>
<p>Cath:  I encourage my own child to respond with, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t do x&#8230; I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate:  I do the same, Cath, if my children need me to, I&#8217;ll give them the words to use to make sure their feelings are known.</p>
<p>Christie: As a teacher of 2-5 year olds I always taught the children to say &#8220;Stop&#8221; in a loud voice, to empower them and the loud voice helps to attract adult attention (so the adult can come and help the children resolve the situation).  Most two year olds can say &#8220;Stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kate:  We use the same phrase, &#8216;Stop &#8211; I don&#8217;t like that&#8217;</p>
<p>Christie:  And then obviously older children can say, &#8220;Stop, I don&#8217;t like it when you &#8230;&#8221; and give more of an explanation.</p>
<p>Cath:  I think right there we are preparing ourselves, and our kids, to move away from us little by little.</p>
<p>Christie:  It is about equipping them so that we feel we can step away.</p>
<p>Cath:  Exactly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>What about you?  Do you struggle with letting go of your kids?  Are you more guilty of hovering than you expected you&#8217;d be?  Feel free to share your thoughts on helicopter parenting here or on Christie or Kate&#8217;s blogs.</strong></p>
