				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://livinglocurto.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5904" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Morning_cards-livinglocurto.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><em></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The start of the day can be harrowing, especially if you have kids of different ages who need to get to different places!  The only way I know of getting everyone out of the door on time and with everything they need, is to establish good routines and stick to them.  Routine charts can be incredibly helpful for a child&#8217;s growing independence.  Young kids who can manage a few steps independently in the morning, become kids who are responsible for their own school materials, and then become teens who are capable of managing their own timetables.</p>
<p><span id="more-5901"></span></p>
<p>I chatted with Liam, Robbie and Jo on air this morning about routine charts on Brisbane&#8217;s 96Five.  If you missed it, check out the <a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=11331">podcast</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=11331"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5902" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/96five.gif" alt="" width="223" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Summary points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t confuse reward charts with routine charts</li>
<li>Move from photographs, to pictorial symbols, to words and symbols, then finally to timetables</li>
<li>Keep it age appropriate (a 4 year old can probably manage a 4 step morning routine&#8230; a 6 year old can manage 6 steps)</li>
<li>Remember that the aim is independence! Let them be responsible for their tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three ways to go about starting off a new routine chart for your child.  You can make it yourself from scratch, use one that others find works for them, or buy a ready-made one.  The advantage of making your own is that you can truly personalise it for your child.  Photos are especially effective for young kids.  Take a photo of the breakfast cereal, the kindy bag, the school uniform, the sunscreen&#8230; whatever!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to use a routine chart from other mums, try one of these:</p>
<p><a href="http://childhood101.com/2011/06/literacy-spot-24-routines-with-free-printable-picture-cards/">Childhood101</a> &#8211; I highly recommend Christie&#8217;s FREE printable routine cards for young kids. Photos ready to go!</p>

<p><a href="http://theorganisedhousewife.com.au/printables/kids-charts/">The Organised Housewife</a> &#8211; Print out Katrina&#8217;s FREE morning or evening routine chart for primary school kids.</p>
<p><a href="http://getbuttonedup.com/2011/11/03/tool-free-printable-kids-schedule-sheet/">Buttoned Up</a> &#8211; Try this FREE weekly schedule for kids in middle school. Laminate it, then fill it out together at the start of each week with a fine whiteboard marker.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.littlebillies.net/">Little Billies</a> &#8211; I <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/little-billies-giveaway/">reviewed these charts a couple of years ago</a> but sadly they are no longer available <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif" alt=":-(" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong>The verdict?</strong>  All four of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay at <a href="http://www.hiltonsurfersparadise.com.au/">The Hilton</a> on the Gold Coast.  The suite we stayed in was gorgeous, with superb finishes and beautiful views.  Staying with two kids under 5, I was grateful for the well equipped kitchenette and decent sized bath!  With only a double bed in the second bedroom the kids had to share &#8211; which was a novelty for our munchkins, but could be difficult with older kids.  The service was impeccable and breakfasts were a real highlight of our stay.  I would love to see the Hilton add a few little extras for families, like child friendly toiletries (such as bubble bath) and a small packet of wipes for messy fingers!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The last month has been challenging journey for our little family through some ups and downs.</p>
<p>One of us came down with the flu, just as the other recovered.</p>
<p>One of us flew away from Brisbane, just as the other returned.</p>
<p>One family said hello to us, just as we say goodbye to another.</p>
<p>One friend welcomed a new baby, while heartbreakingly another will bury hers this week.<span id="more-5686"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mountain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5687" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mountain.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="360" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">When the going gets tough, priorities are stripped back to the barest essentials.  Social media seems unimportant when friends nearby desperately need a meal.  Keeping up with my reader comes second to keeping up with the housework.  And when we need to spend time as a family, talking about the big things of life and processing our feelings &#8211; the blog and everything else can wait.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I value my readers highly, and I love sharing with you all, but the truth is that you don&#8217;t <em>need</em> me.  My children and my husband, and close friends do.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I didn&#8217;t start this post with, &#8220;<em>Sorry I haven&#8217;t blogged for a while&#8230;&#8221;</em> and I never will.  I&#8217;m not sorry.  Prioritising my family is the right thing to do.  I cannot possibly blog, speak or write with integrity about parenting if I don&#8217;t practise what I preach!  So please bear with me during the times I am less active online.  It simply means I am doing double-time offline; nurturing, loving and caring for those who truly need me.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">And I know you understand that.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">xx</p>

<p>We talk a lot about feelings in our home.  Feelings are tricky things to deal with, but it&#8217;s much healthier to learn to deal with them than to pretend we all feel happy all the time.  &#8216;Cause let&#8217;s face it &#8211; we don&#8217;t.  Some days <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/when-daddy-has-depression/">Daddy feels sad</a>.  Some days I am irritable.  Some days the kids are out-of-sorts without any particular reason.  And all of those things are ok.</p>
<p>Without making a big deal about it, I try to give the kids practical tools to deal with their own feelings, and the emotions of others.  It&#8217;s important that they learn to <strong>name </strong>their feelings, and that they feel safe enough to <strong>share </strong>their feelings.  Of course, this is all good in theory! I can&#8217;t say I always get it right, but I am aware that it is part of my responsibility as their mother.  Here are some phrases I try to use, and some I try to avoid when it comes to feelings.</p>
<p>Things I DO say to the kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you feel today?</li>
<li>Would you like to tell me about your feelings?</li>
<li>I can see that you are sad/angry/etc. Can you use your words to talk to me about it?</li>
<li>Is anything worrying you?</li>
<li>It&#8217;s ok to feel angry, but it&#8217;s not ok to let your anger hurt anyone else.</li>
<li>It&#8217;s ok to feel sad. Is there anything I can do to help?</li>
</ul>
<p>Things I DON&#8217;T say to the kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>What&#8217;s wrong with you?</li>
<li>Cheer up.</li>
<li>That&#8217;s not worth crying about.</li>
<li>Do ___________ and you&#8217;ll feel better.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t be silly.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>How do you deal with your children&#8217;s feelings? Do you find talking about feelings difficult?  Which phrases work for you and your kids, and which ones do you avoid saying?</strong></em></p>

<p>Before having children, cleaning the bathroom tiles involved holding my breath and squirting around the strongest chemicals I could find.  Now that I’m a mum I find I am more conscious of what I use to clean our home, and I’m endeavouring to replace many of these toxic products with natural, chemical-free alternatives.  I have actually been rather reluctant to make the change to green cleaning – partly because I was sceptical it would really work, and partly for fear of being labelled.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/does_green_really_clean.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-5530  aligncenter" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/does_green_really_clean-300x212.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="212" /></a></p>
<p>Yes*. At least, so far so good in our home.  The first green-clean change I made has proven to be incredibly effective, and it’s my number one chemical free cleaning tip.  All I did was switch to using environmentally friendly microfibre cloths.  These cloths have eliminated three quarters of my cleaning products.  There are a few brands on the market, some of which can be purchased off the shelves in the supermarket, and others which are sold through party-plan schemes.  They clean efficiently using only water, and work by trapping dirt in their teeny tiny fibres.  They can be washed and reused many times over too.  We have a lot of glass in our home and I am amazed at how easily I can clean it all with only two cloths and a little water.  And because it’s completely chemical free – the kids can help with cleaning the mirrors, tiles, benches, windows, table and kitchen chairs too!</p>
<p>The next green-clean change I am making is to replace the remaining chemicals I use in our home with natural alternatives.  Instead of viewing the remedies my great grandmother may have used to remove mould as outdated, I am starting to appreciate them for their simplicity.  (Mould has been a widespread problem in Queensland following the drenching we received earlier this year.)  I can only wonder what’s in the bottle of spray in my laundry which claims to eradicate mould, and the smell of the chemical concoction is unbearable.  My great granny would most likely have used tea-tree oil, borax or vinegar.</p>

<p>I wouldn’t call myself a Green Queen yet, but I am definitely making better choices for my family and I am much more aware of the toxins I use in our home.  I still use the odd chemical here and there, which I hope to eventually replace with alternatives that are better both for the environment and for our health.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tree-girl.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5505" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/tree-girl.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a><br />
</em></p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, my 5 year old fell out of her <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">favourite climbing tree</a>.  I was out in the backyard with the kids, saw her fall, and was by her side within seconds. She lost consciousness and suffered an impact seizure, which was scary for both of us. This type of seizure can occur with a concussive brain injury and happens just seconds after impact.  When she came to, she was understandably frightened and confused.</p>
<p>The emergency department of our local hospital saw her immediately.  (I am so grateful for the way Australian medical professionals prioritise children.)  Although shaken, and very overwhelmed by the sights and smells of a hospital &#8211; she was alert and cooperative.  I cuddled and reassured her, talked her through what was happening, and stayed as calm as I could.  She was closely monitored for the first hour or two, then checked hourly until the recommended 6hrs had passed.  She was back to her usual self in a few hours though, and spent the last part of her hospital visit bored out of her little brain!</p>
<p>During those six hours at her bedside, I had plenty of time to think about my parenting choices. Could I have prevented her fall? Should I have prevented her fall? Was I doing the right thing allowing her to climb trees? Would I still encourage her to take reasonable risks?  Would I change any of my beliefs about children and nature&#8230;?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/hospital1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5507" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/hospital1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>The doctors helped me to retain a commonsense view.  One doctor reminded me that she could have fallen anywhere&#8230; inside or out.  Another laughed about his own tree climbing adventures as a child, and reminisced about the way his mother handled it when he fell.  When we were finally discharged at 10pm, he also encouraged Miss 5 to keep climbing and exploring the world.</p>
<p>Today, she is at home enjoying a quiet day under Mummy&#8217;s watchful eye.  Tomorrow, she&#8217;ll be back at school with a great story to tell.  Next week, she&#8217;ll probably be back up the tree! And me?  I guess I&#8217;m a little shaken too.  No parent ever likes to see their child hurt.  There is a little part of my mama-heart that wishes I could wrap my kids up and hold them close to keep them safe.  There is a much bigger part of my mama-brain though that reminds me I cannot parent out of fear, and I cannot protect them from all of life&#8217;s falls.</p>
<p><em>And so, I STILL believe that kids and nature belong together, and I will continue to encourage my  children to play daily outside, exploring their backyard and the natural  elements in it.  I still believe that <a href="../kids/climbing-trees/">tree climbing is one of childhood&#8217;s greatest joys</a>.   I still believe that happy kids require both freedom and boundaries.  I  still believe children&#8217;s environments should be as safe as necessary, rather  than as safe as possible.  And I still believe that falling down is a normal  part of an active childhood.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pwk-leaderboard-480X60.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/pwk-leaderboard-480X60.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="60" /></a></p>
<p>I often describe my life  as organised chaos. I&#8217;m a too-busy mama with too many to-do lists and not enough hours in the day!  Sometimes the result is a big, full, happy, satisfying week.  At other times though, the result is a frazzled mother, cranky kids and a messy home.  I&#8217;m always inspired by other women who are still busy, yet manage to calm the chaos.<span id="more-5042"></span> Nicole Avery is one of those women.  She is a spreadsheet queen, mum of five,well known blogger and now author! Yes, the <a href="http://planningwithkids.com">Planning With Kids</a> blog is now a book.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Planning-with-Kids-Front-Cover-500-x-754.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5262" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Planning-with-Kids-Front-Cover-500-x-754.jpg" alt="" width="256" height="386" /></a></p>
<p>The book  is full of advice, suggestions, and tried-and-true ideas.  In addition to her own thoughts, Nicole has included quotes from mums and mummy-bloggers all over the country. Yours truly is featured in Part I (p4) in the chapter on <strong>Routines </strong>and their importance in family life.  I am NOT, however, offering any advice in the following chapters meal planning, or spreadsheeting your family finances!</p>
<p>Part II contains great common-sense advice for babies, toddlers, preschoolers and school aged children. I enjoyed reading this section and found myself nodding along much of the way.  I also picked up some wonderful tips from Nicole, and from the other quoted mums with children a little older than mine. There is always something we can learn from those who have gone before us.</p>
<p>Part III is about prioritising yourself, and your relationship with your husband (or partner).  Nic sets ten personal goals for herself every year, and holds herself accountable to them too! She also makes time each week to go to the gym, spend time blogging, and even schedules a Sunday sleep in.  She also has some really worthwhile advice to share about keeping your marriage strong while raising kids.  Part IV is all about family fun!  <strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Nicole-Avery-Planning-Queen-200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5264 alignright" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Nicole-Avery-Planning-Queen-200.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="160" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>This Friday, 10th June, Nicole is flying up from Melbourne to my sunny home town of Brisbane. She will be appearing at Westfield Chermside, 10am at Dymocks, to sign copies of her book. </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I know she would love to meet lots of her Brissy readers and it would be great to see you there.  We won&#8217;t be hard to find. She&#8217;ll be the one sitting at an organised desk with copies of her book, spare pens, bloggy business cards in one pocket and bandaids in the other. I&#8217;ll be the one beside her with frazzled hair&#8230;</p>

<p>Does your husband or parter travel for business?  Do they work shifts, or unusual hours, which you leave you flying solo?  Or are you a full-time single parent?</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you cope?</strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Where do you and your family go when you really need to get away from it all?  For us it&#8217;s the rainforest.  When I&#8217;m there my heart rate slows down, my brain stops buzzing quite so loudly, and feel like I can breathe.
