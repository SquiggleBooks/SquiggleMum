				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://birdlife.org.au/">Bird Week</a>! I don&#8217;t really need an excuse to take my kids birdwatching because it&#8217;s my favourite weekend activity &#8211; but I realise it&#8217;s not a usual outing for most families. If you like the idea of birding but don&#8217;t really know how to tackle it with kids, here are some tips to help you out.<span id="more-6527"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6530" alt="kids birding squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg" width="613" height="408" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go at the right time</strong>. Birds are most active at sunrise and dusk. If your kids are early risers, make the most of it by heading out first thing. There are birds around at any time of day, but they are often less active during the middle of the day which can make it harder to see them.</li>
<li><strong>Pick the right place. </strong>Birds can be found everywhere &#8211; from backyard to beach to bush. However, if you pick your place carefully you will increase your chance of seeing a wider variety of species. I recommend finding a quiet, bushy spot near running water.</li>
<li><strong>Take the right gear</strong>. My kids love packing their own backpack. They take their own binoculars and/or camera, their hat, water bottle, and a snack. I usually also take an Australian bird identification book. (If you prefer something lighter, try a bird app. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/michael-morcombe-david-stewart/id397979505?mt=8">Morcombe &#8211; Stewart eGuide</a> is about the same price as the book but weighs a lot less! There is also a free lite version.)</li>
<li><strong>Wear the right clothing</strong>. Make sure your kids have sensible shoes and clothing for spending time outdoors. It&#8217;s a good idea to pre-apply insect repellant too, especially around ankles. Don&#8217;t forget hat and sunscreen.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the right weather</strong>. The birds won&#8217;t mind if the weather is miserable, but the kids will! Birding in the rain is only for hardcore bird nerds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow up activities for kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a picture of a bird you saw</li>
<li>Count how many birds you saw</li>
<li>Count how many species you saw</li>
<li>Print out a picture of a bird you photographed</li>
<li>Identify a bird you saw using the <a href="http://birdsinbackyards.net/finder">Birds in Backyards Bird Finder</a> or a bird book</li>
<li>Research a bird you saw and find out some interesting facts</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Have you ever been bird watching with your kids? Any other tips to share? </strong></em></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have bamboo in our backyard that goes wild after good rain. Out of nowhere the spears shoot up, rising way past the top of our 6ft fence, before sprouting leaves. It provides great screening, but often needs serious pruning! The kids have used the  pruned <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/outdoor-multi-age-play/">bamboo spears in their play </a>in the past. Recently we tried something new.<span id="more-6265"></span></p>
<p>Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>To make our panflute we first stripped the bamboo of leaves and cut sections of bamboo, which the kids ordered according to length. We wrapped string around the first section, joining it to the second, then the third, and so on. This was a bit fiddly. We then wrapped string around all of the five sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, we wrapped in between each section. This helped to pull it all together tightly. We trimmed all of the ends and left them hanging at one side. Traditionally these were often plaited decoratively, or used to create a neck strap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As you can see from the photos, our panflute is fairly rudimentary! We could have sanded the cut sections of bamboo, we could have sealed the ends with wax, we could have used a crossbar&#8230; If you want to try a more authentic method, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-4-easy-Bamboo-Flutes-for-free/step4/Bamboo-Flute-Panflute/">instructables</a> have a 50+ step DIY guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>For us, the fun of this activity was in making something from nothing. We created a real musical instrument with string, secateurs, and a plant from the backyard. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6269" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">What could you and your kids create in the backyard together&#8230;?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about free play: it requires very, very little. <strong>Children who are good at free play know how to make their own fun.</strong> They don&#8217;t need an adult to provide them with toys. They don&#8217;t need an adult to outline the rules. They don&#8217;t need an adult to explain the process. They don&#8217;t need an adult at all really! Free play can happen any time, any where, with whatever is around.<span id="more-6191"></span></p>
<p>My favourite memory from our recent trip to Far North Queensland was an afternoon spent on the beach at Cape Tribulation. Cape Trib is across the Daintree River by barge, as far north as you can drive in a regular vehicle. It&#8217;s literally the end of the road, though it feels more like the edge of the world. So beautiful.</p>
<p>With no toys and no plans, the kids enjoyed an afternoon of free play with only the things they found on the beach. Here&#8217;s what they did:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6194" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Collect.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Investigate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-imagine.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6196" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-imagine.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="599" /></a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[5 outdoor activities using tin cans, plus win a MILO Play Kit]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very pleased to be an ambassador for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/miloausnz">MILO Play Movement</a> in 2012.  Play is a child&#8217;s work, and the importance of play in children&#8217;s development cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>MILO sent the SquiggleKids a fantastic play kit (final photo) to use in the backyard &#8211; and <strong>I&#8217;ve got one play kit to give away to a lucky SquiggleMum reader as well</strong>!  The kit contains soccer nets, cones, a selection of different balls and even a ball pump for your kids to use outside, plus a couple of tins of MILO.<span id="more-6036"></span></p>
<p>So of course, you know what my kids have had the most fun with, don&#8217;t you&#8230;?  <strong>The tins!!  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6041" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Kids have been inventing games with MILO tins for as long as MILO has been around. The labels might have changed, but not much else has. Here are 5 activities that are sure to bring back memories, and your own kids might like them too:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1.  Tin can stilts</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">2. Tin can telephone</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6043" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">3. Tin can bucket (on pulley rope)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6044" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">4. Tin can bowling</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6045" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">5. Tin can drums</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-drums.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6046" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-drums.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids have had SO much fun playing with a couple of tins. Sometimes I think commercial toys are entirely overrated.  That said, they were also pretty excited about this stuff:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6047" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/identifying-birds-eggs/">keen birdwatcher</a>, Miss 5 knows the scientific names of a few of her favourite species.  The first one she learned was <em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em> &#8211; the scientific name for a Rainbow Lorikeet.  The second was the closely related <em>Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus</em>, or Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.  From this early introduction to scientific names, my daughter discovered that:<span id="more-6001"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>all living things have a common name and scientific name</li>
<li>every different type of living thing has its own special scientific name</li>
<li>scientific names have two words (usually)</li>
<li>scientific names have funny words that sound different to every-day words</li>
<li>animals that are similar might have similar names (eg: first word the same, second word different)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this week, when we discovered an unusual species of fungi in the yard, I asked the kids this question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were the first scientist to discover this amazing species, what would you call it?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I know &#8211; weird, right?!  We discussed its unusual shape, vibrant colour, pungent smell, and &#8220;tentacles&#8221; while thinking of a name.  Miss 5 said the first word should be <em>Fungus </em>(based on her understanding of scientific names).  Maybe <em>Fungus Octopus</em>? What about<em> Fungus Redstar </em>or<em> Fungus Crazy?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em></em>And then&#8230; the game was on!  Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for other fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are the, ahem, un-scientific names of species as decided by the SquiggleKids:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Orangey</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6004" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Rosy </em>(named and written by Mr 3)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Goldiae</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Umbrellus</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids ran with this activity because it was of interest to them.  (Not all kids would find fungi so fascinating!)  Even my three year old wanted to &#8220;write&#8221; his own sign, and I loved seeing his purposeful scribble.  This kind of scribble is early writing at its finest.  I especially liked my daughter&#8217;s <em>Fungus Umbrellus</em>.  We discussed how the word <em>umbrella</em> sounded like an everyday word, but <em>umbrellus</em> sounded like a &#8220;science&#8221; word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both kids were so proud of their efforts too, and couldn&#8217;t wait to show SquiggleDad their discoveries. I think I have a couple of young naturalists on my hands!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The amazing life cycle of a cicada. We watched this cicada nymph emerge as an adult in our own backyard. Fascinating. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: MUM! You have to see this. It&#8217;s weird. And cool. <em>M-U-M</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5934" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think that&#8217;s a cicada nymph.  Can you see the shell underneath? We sometimes find empty cicada shells, don&#8217;t we? It looks like this little guy didn&#8217;t quite make it out.  <span id="more-5933"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5935" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>A few minutes later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Mum, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s dead after all. He&#8217;s moving!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5936" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: You&#8217;re right! He&#8217;s pulling himself up to the tree now, and I think those wings are getting bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5937" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Now his whole body has come out of the shell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Wow, look how his abdomen curls out like that. It really IS weird and cool. You were right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I know.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5938" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Whoa! Check out his wings!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Are they growing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: No, I think they are just getting bigger as they are drying out. See how they are wrinkly and curled up? I think they need to be all smooth before he can fly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">Butterflies</a> have to wait for their wings to dry before they can fly too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Good thinking. I wonder if all flying insects have to wait for their wings to dry&#8230;?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5939" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Do you think his wings are ready now Mum?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I don&#8217;t know. I guess we&#8217;ll have to keep watching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5940" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: He&#8217;s crawling away from his shell now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Maybe he&#8217;s not quite ready for flying yet&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mr 3: I can get him and &#8220;fly&#8221; him for you if you like</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5 and Me: <strong>NO!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5943" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="398" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>An hour later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Dinner time kids. Time to come inside now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: But I want to see him fly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5942" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Let&#8217;s take one last photo before the sun sets. Can you see how his wings are much closer to his body now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Before they were out flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think he will stay there now until it&#8217;s dark, and fly away in the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5941" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I&#8217;ll check if he&#8217;s gone in the morning&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you have a child who is into bugs, you might like to watch the following 5min documentary snippet from Sir David Attenborough about the life cycle of cicadas in America.  (Stop it at the 4min mark if you aren&#8217;t ready to explain what the male and female adult insects are doing together&#8230;)  In Australia, our cicadas don&#8217;t emerge on mass the same way &#8211; but they are still pretty noisy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you don&#8217;t live in Brisbane&#8217;s northern suburbs, and in case you missed the pics on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum" target="_blank">facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum" target="_blank">twitter</a>&#8230; yes, my kids were on the front page of the local paper.  I might be slightly biased but I think it&#8217;s a great photo.  Not just because they&#8217;re both smiling and looking at the camera, but because they are swinging from a rope ladder in our backyard.</p>
<p><span id="more-5844"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-frnt-page.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5845" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-frnt-page.png" alt="" width="600" height="478" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I love the headline too: <em>Swing back to good old fun</em>.  Couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself!  Even after receiving lots of lovely new things for Christmas, my kids are still happiest when they are monkeying around freely in the backyard.  This $12 rope ladder has provided hours of priceless fun and is still going strong after a year outside!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The front page pic is accompanied by a story and photo on page 5 about playscapes.  In the article, Rebekah Hurworth from <a href="http://yourarchitect.com.au/" target="_blank">Your Architect</a> says, &#8220;<em>&#8230; by incorporating sandpits, rockpools, cubby houses, reading areas and outdoor kitchen areas, children can spend hours entertaining themselves outside.</em>&#8221;  If you are interested in natural playscapes, you might also like to read this great pdf <a href="http://www.kidsafensw.org/docs/factsheets/PAU/Natural%20Playspaces%20KL%202011.pdf">fact sheet from Kidsafe</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-pg5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5846" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/northwest-pg5.png" alt="" width="501" height="457" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">You can see our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/backyard-sand-play/">sandpit</a>, the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">dry creek bed</a> and one of the bridges in the background, plus a bucket hanging from a pulley under the trees.  Our playscape is ever changing and growing, and always has something to offer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>What do your kids do in the backyard?  And what did YOU do outside as a kid??</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PS &#8211; Yes, my kids usually have hats on outside <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PPS &#8211; Yes, the architect is also my little sister <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

		<description><![CDATA[I have been scouring second hand shops and sites for a while now, hoping to find a small sink for our much-loved dirt kitchen.  So I was completely delighted to come across this discarded laundry tub recently. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know that saying, &#8220;One person&#8217;s trash is another person&#8217;s treasure&#8230;&#8221;?!  Never has it been more true.<span id="more-5721"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5722" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I have been scouring second hand shops and sites for a while now, hoping to find a small sink for our <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">much-loved dirt kitchen</a>.  So, I was completely delighted to come across this discarded laundry tub recently.  I hadn&#8217;t considered a laundry tub, but the deep single trough is perfect for outdoor <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/water-play/">water play</a>.  I also love the green colour which blends in fantastically with the dirt kitchen and surrounding trees.  (The kids&#8217; needs come first in our playscape, but I&#8217;ll admit I still prefer the back yard not to be an eyesore!)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I thought about building a simple wooden structure to support the sink, but the kids were desperate to start using it so I propped it up on some bricks.  I made sure there was enough clearance underneath for the drain to flow freely, and the kids dug their own channel for the water to run out into the yard.  As it turned out, this has worked perfectly &#8211; so the bricks are staying for now!  The sink is tucked away beside the existing dirt kitchen, nestled between the trunks of a few big trees.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I&#8217;m pleased to report that the grand total for this project was only a couple of dollars.  Yep, the cost of a plug.  I could have spent a hundred dollars on a fancy plastic water table, but I doubt my munchkins would have any more fun with it than they do with this tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5723" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/dirt-kitchen-sink2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Please don&#8217;t be fooled into thinking you need to spend big dollars on your children.  Keep your eye out for &#8220;treasures&#8221; and just let your kids be kids outside.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My kids are energetic.  Very energetic.  I think most happy, healthy kids are &#8211; but it&#8217;s good to slow them down sometimes and help them to notice life&#8217;s little things.  One way we like to do this outside is to go on a bug hunt.  There are interesting insects and other small creatures all around, but often we don&#8217;t notice them because we are too busy.  Open your child&#8217;s eyes to the wonder of bugs!<span id="more-5707"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/red-bugs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5709" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/red-bugs.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="630" /></a></p>
<p>Although you can go on a bug hunt with nothing but a pair of eyes, kids often respond more enthusiastically when they have a few &#8220;tools&#8221; to use.  You might even like to make up a bug-kit for your child, with some of the following items.</p>
<ul>
<li>Magnifying glass &#8211; for looking up close. Even young kids enjoy the magic of magnification.</li>
<li>Camera or smart phone &#8211; our tech savvy kids are quite used to having Mum&#8217;s phone on hand to take photos of interesting things!  This is a good way to let them have a go at taking photos independently.</li>
<li>Notebook and pencil &#8211; older children may like to make a list (words or pictures) of the insects they find.</li>
<li>Tweezers &#8211; not for bugs!! These can be useful for gently lifting up leaves and bark from the ground to reveal creatures hidden underneath.  Great activity for developing fine motor skills too.</li>
<li>Bug catcher &#8211; Depending on what your kids find, they may want to put an insect into a bug catcher to observe more closely. Unless we are sure an insect is safe to touch, we put critters into the bug catcher by picking up the leaf or stick they are on, rather than picking up the bug.  I encourage my kids to release any creatures they have caught at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Activities like this also provide an opportunity for conversations about nature. Try asking some of these questions when your child discovers an interesting critter.  Remember that open ended questions require your child to think at a higher level, and create much richer discussions.</p>
<p><strong>Simple Questions</strong><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stink_bugs.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5711 alignright" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/stink_bugs.jpg" alt="" width="283" height="384" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>What colour is it?</li>
<li>How many legs does it have?</li>
<li>Where did you find it?</li>
<li>Is it bigger or smaller than your fingernail?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Open Ended Questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is it similar to any other bugs you have seen? In what way?</li>
<li>If you were a scientist in charge of naming this creature, what would you call it?</li>
<li>What do you think it eats? Why?</li>
<li>What do you think might eat IT?</li>
<li>Do you think the babies and adults of this bug look the same as each other, or different. Why do you think that?</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Happy hunting!</strong></em></p>
