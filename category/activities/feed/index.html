				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#8217;s <a href="http://birdlife.org.au/">Bird Week</a>! I don&#8217;t really need an excuse to take my kids birdwatching because it&#8217;s my favourite weekend activity &#8211; but I realise it&#8217;s not a usual outing for most families. If you like the idea of birding but don&#8217;t really know how to tackle it with kids, here are some tips to help you out.<span id="more-6527"></span></p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-6530" alt="kids birding squigglemum" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kids-birding-squigglemum.jpeg" width="613" height="408" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Go at the right time</strong>. Birds are most active at sunrise and dusk. If your kids are early risers, make the most of it by heading out first thing. There are birds around at any time of day, but they are often less active during the middle of the day which can make it harder to see them.</li>
<li><strong>Pick the right place. </strong>Birds can be found everywhere &#8211; from backyard to beach to bush. However, if you pick your place carefully you will increase your chance of seeing a wider variety of species. I recommend finding a quiet, bushy spot near running water.</li>
<li><strong>Take the right gear</strong>. My kids love packing their own backpack. They take their own binoculars and/or camera, their hat, water bottle, and a snack. I usually also take an Australian bird identification book. (If you prefer something lighter, try a bird app. The <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/michael-morcombe-david-stewart/id397979505?mt=8">Morcombe &#8211; Stewart eGuide</a> is about the same price as the book but weighs a lot less! There is also a free lite version.)</li>
<li><strong>Wear the right clothing</strong>. Make sure your kids have sensible shoes and clothing for spending time outdoors. It&#8217;s a good idea to pre-apply insect repellant too, especially around ankles. Don&#8217;t forget hat and sunscreen.</li>
<li><strong>Wait for the right weather</strong>. The birds won&#8217;t mind if the weather is miserable, but the kids will! Birding in the rain is only for hardcore bird nerds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Follow up activities for kids:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draw a picture of a bird you saw</li>
<li>Count how many birds you saw</li>
<li>Count how many species you saw</li>
<li>Print out a picture of a bird you photographed</li>
<li>Identify a bird you saw using the <a href="http://birdsinbackyards.net/finder">Birds in Backyards Bird Finder</a> or a bird book</li>
<li>Research a bird you saw and find out some interesting facts</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Have you ever been bird watching with your kids? Any other tips to share? </strong></em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Once again blogging has taken a back seat to real life, as we farewell our hometown of Brisbane. Relocating a family is a huge undertaking! We have spent the last few weeks in a whirlwind of cleaning, clearing, decluttering, and <a href="http://gumtree.com.au">gumtree</a>-ing in order to sell our home. At the same time, we&#8217;ve also been flying down to Sydney to find a suburb that will work for our family, and then lining up new home and school. Oh, and in between, catching up &#8220;just one more time&#8221; with all of our beautiful friends here in Brisbane.<span id="more-6297"></span></p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say goodbye to our home. We moved here as new parents with a baby girl, and the house needed a LOT of work. Over the past seven years we have slowly but surely renovated it to suit our style and our growing family. Look at it now!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6298" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/squiggle-house-living.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" /></a></p>
<p>The backyard has also seen more than a few changes, and so many of them have featured here on the blog.</p>
<ul>
<li>We  created our own <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/how-to-build-a-creek-bed/">dry creek bed</a>.</li>
<li>We built a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/dirt-kitchen-then-and-now/">dirt kitchen</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/backyard-letterbox/">post box</a>.</li>
<li>We installed huge <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/outdoor-chalk-boards/">chalk boards</a>.</li>
<li>We added <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/fence-storage/">toy storage</a>.</li>
<li>We <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">climbed trees</a>. And <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">fell out of them</a>.</li>
<li>We added a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/our-rope-ladder/">rope ladder</a>.</li>
<li>We created a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/garden-in-a-week/">veggie garden</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The kids have really grown up in this back yard! Together we have explored</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/finding-frogs-catch-and-release/">frogs</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">butterflies</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/watching-nature-unfold-cicada/">cicadas</a>, and other <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bug-hunt/">insects</a></li>
<li>Plant life: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/seedpods/">seedpods</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/fantastic-fungus/">fungi</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/literacy/scientific-literacy/">more fungi</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am so glad I have these posts as a record of our outdoor adventures in their pre-school years. Now at 7 and 4, the kids are getting older and their needs in our new backyard will be different &#8211; but I know these early experiences will impact on the way they play. They know how to <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/sticks-and-stones/">make their own fun</a>, <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/the-big-branch/">solve problems together</a>, and <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/bamboo-panflutes/">be creative</a> outdoors.</p>
<p>I am sad to say goodbye to this home, but grateful for all the learning and growing that has happened here. And I am ready for what is next&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have bamboo in our backyard that goes wild after good rain. Out of nowhere the spears shoot up, rising way past the top of our 6ft fence, before sprouting leaves. It provides great screening, but often needs serious pruning! The kids have used the  pruned <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/outdoor-multi-age-play/">bamboo spears in their play </a>in the past. Recently we tried something new.<span id="more-6265"></span></p>
<p>Panflutes or panpipes are very old, and very simple.  They are pitched, meaning you can play different notes with them, and sound is made by blowing across the bamboo sections of varying length.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6266" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute1.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p>To make our panflute we first stripped the bamboo of leaves and cut sections of bamboo, which the kids ordered according to length. We wrapped string around the first section, joining it to the second, then the third, and so on. This was a bit fiddly. We then wrapped string around all of the five sections.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6267" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute2.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Finally, we wrapped in between each section. This helped to pull it all together tightly. We trimmed all of the ends and left them hanging at one side. Traditionally these were often plaited decoratively, or used to create a neck strap.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6268" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute3.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As you can see from the photos, our panflute is fairly rudimentary! We could have sanded the cut sections of bamboo, we could have sealed the ends with wax, we could have used a crossbar&#8230; If you want to try a more authentic method, <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Make-4-easy-Bamboo-Flutes-for-free/step4/Bamboo-Flute-Panflute/">instructables</a> have a 50+ step DIY guide.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>For us, the fun of this activity was in making something from nothing. We created a real musical instrument with string, secateurs, and a plant from the backyard. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6269" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/panflute4.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">What could you and your kids create in the backyard together&#8230;?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about free play: it requires very, very little. <strong>Children who are good at free play know how to make their own fun.</strong> They don&#8217;t need an adult to provide them with toys. They don&#8217;t need an adult to outline the rules. They don&#8217;t need an adult to explain the process. They don&#8217;t need an adult at all really! Free play can happen any time, any where, with whatever is around.<span id="more-6191"></span></p>
<p>My favourite memory from our recent trip to Far North Queensland was an afternoon spent on the beach at Cape Tribulation. Cape Trib is across the Daintree River by barge, as far north as you can drive in a regular vehicle. It&#8217;s literally the end of the road, though it feels more like the edge of the world. So beautiful.</p>
<p>With no toys and no plans, the kids enjoyed an afternoon of free play with only the things they found on the beach. Here&#8217;s what they did:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6194" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Collect.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">Investigate.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have previously shared some thoughts about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">children and risk</a>, both here on the blog and <a href="http://96five.com">on air</a>. And when my daughter knocked herself out by <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">falling while tree climbing</a> &#8211; my opinion was challenged, but ultimately unchanged.</p>
<p>While I am happy to share my perspective as an educator and a mother, I am not a child psychologist myself, so I was delighted to be able to interview <a href="http://www.pathwayshrc.com.au/about-us/professor-paula-barrett/">Dr Paula Barrett</a> about this topic.  Here are her thoughts on the risky business of childhood.<span id="more-6139"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6142" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Yes, my kids are playing with sticks&#8230;!)</p>
<p><strong>Paula, why is it important for children to be allowed to take risks in their play?</strong></p>
<p>There are several reasons but mainly because children learn and gain resilience through challenging experiences. If a child only ever does things within their comfort zone, where they completely understand all the potential outcomes, they don’t learn how to deal with not always achieving the right result or potential disappointment, which is extremely important in later life. Children learn the most when they are challenged.</p>
<p><strong>As parents, how do we know what is reasonable risk, and what is dangerous? </strong></p>
<p>Risk needs to be determined dependant on the particular child and what is developmentally appropriate. For example, a very young child may be able to climb a tree but doesn’t actually yet have the muscle strength for a successful climb – which can result in a dangerous situation. It is very useful to listen to your support networks to help guide you on this, such as grandparents who have great experience and parents with kids of a similar age as they may have dealt with similar situations.  There are also other networks you can rely on who have studied in this area, for example, child care workers, sport coaches etc – they can often make a valuable contribution to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Have today&#8217;s parents become too risk averse?  Why do you think this has happened?</strong></p>
<p>There are so many reasons for this but I think the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents are more isolated when bringing up children than they used to be. Involving your support networks can help you better evaluate risk by including those with experience, like grandparents or parents with kids of similar ages.</li>
<li>There are just so many rules – which are good in that they protect society at large however they can also inhibit children to take risk.</li>
<li>Kids time today is increasingly over-structured with too many scheduled activities &#8211; which minimises the opportunities children to be challenged outside of being told what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should we do to encourage children who are not natural risk takers?</strong></p>
<p>A great way to encourage children who are not natural risk takers is to help them form friendships with children who are.</p>
<p>And, as parents you can reassure them through modelling the behaviour– go outside with them and get involved.  You can try a step plan where you encourage them to face challenging situations in small steps – maybe once a week or once a fortnight, only moving them to the next step when they are ready.  It helps to reward them but not with things that you buy – it is more powerful to dedicate time to something that they love doing e.g. take them to the beach or build a cubby house with them.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any evidence to suggest that encouraging kids to take risks in play might lead to risky behaviour later in life? </strong></p>
<p>No, there is none at all! Children taking risks during play build self-confidence, whereas developing good judgement or self-regulation is another issue all together. Risk taking in adulthood is more about personality and life choices.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[5 outdoor activities using tin cans, plus win a MILO Play Kit]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m very pleased to be an ambassador for the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/miloausnz">MILO Play Movement</a> in 2012.  Play is a child&#8217;s work, and the importance of play in children&#8217;s development cannot be underestimated.</p>
<p>MILO sent the SquiggleKids a fantastic play kit (final photo) to use in the backyard &#8211; and <strong>I&#8217;ve got one play kit to give away to a lucky SquiggleMum reader as well</strong>!  The kit contains soccer nets, cones, a selection of different balls and even a ball pump for your kids to use outside, plus a couple of tins of MILO.<span id="more-6036"></span></p>
<p>So of course, you know what my kids have had the most fun with, don&#8217;t you&#8230;?  <strong>The tins!!  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6041" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/old-tin-with-hockey-player-sq.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p>Kids have been inventing games with MILO tins for as long as MILO has been around. The labels might have changed, but not much else has. Here are 5 activities that are sure to bring back memories, and your own kids might like them too:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">1.  Tin can stilts</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6042" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-stilts.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">2. Tin can telephone</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6043" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-phone.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">3. Tin can bucket (on pulley rope)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6044" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bucket-pulley.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">4. Tin can bowling</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6045" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-bowling.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">5. Tin can drums</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> <a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-drums.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6046" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-drums.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids have had SO much fun playing with a couple of tins. Sometimes I think commercial toys are entirely overrated.  That said, they were also pretty excited about this stuff:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6047" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/milo-play-kit.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a></p>

		<description><![CDATA[Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/identifying-birds-eggs/">keen birdwatcher</a>, Miss 5 knows the scientific names of a few of her favourite species.  The first one she learned was <em>Trichoglossus haematodus</em> &#8211; the scientific name for a Rainbow Lorikeet.  The second was the closely related <em>Trichoglossus chlorolepidotus</em>, or Scaly-breasted Lorikeet.  From this early introduction to scientific names, my daughter discovered that:<span id="more-6001"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>all living things have a common name and scientific name</li>
<li>every different type of living thing has its own special scientific name</li>
<li>scientific names have two words (usually)</li>
<li>scientific names have funny words that sound different to every-day words</li>
<li>animals that are similar might have similar names (eg: first word the same, second word different)</li>
</ul>
<p>So this week, when we discovered an unusual species of fungi in the yard, I asked the kids this question&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you were the first scientist to discover this amazing species, what would you call it?</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6002" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-octopus.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">I know &#8211; weird, right?!  We discussed its unusual shape, vibrant colour, pungent smell, and &#8220;tentacles&#8221; while thinking of a name.  Miss 5 said the first word should be <em>Fungus </em>(based on her understanding of scientific names).  Maybe <em>Fungus Octopus</em>? What about<em> Fungus Redstar </em>or<em> Fungus Crazy?  </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em></em>And then&#8230; the game was on!  Armed with a clipboard, crayon and magnifying glass, the kids set about making up names for other fungi they found around the backyard.  They made their own signs and took careful photos of their discoveries.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Here are the, ahem, un-scientific names of species as decided by the SquiggleKids:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6003" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-orangey.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Orangey</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6004" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-red.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Rosy </em>(named and written by Mr 3)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6006" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-goldiae.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Goldiae</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6007" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/fungus-umbrella.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="450" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Fungus Umbrellus</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The kids ran with this activity because it was of interest to them.  (Not all kids would find fungi so fascinating!)  Even my three year old wanted to &#8220;write&#8221; his own sign, and I loved seeing his purposeful scribble.  This kind of scribble is early writing at its finest.  I especially liked my daughter&#8217;s <em>Fungus Umbrellus</em>.  We discussed how the word <em>umbrella</em> sounded like an everyday word, but <em>umbrellus</em> sounded like a &#8220;science&#8221; word.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both kids were so proud of their efforts too, and couldn&#8217;t wait to show SquiggleDad their discoveries. I think I have a couple of young naturalists on my hands!</p>

		<description><![CDATA[The amazing life cycle of a cicada. We watched this cicada nymph emerge as an adult in our own backyard. Fascinating. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: MUM! You have to see this. It&#8217;s weird. And cool. <em>M-U-M</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5934" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think that&#8217;s a cicada nymph.  Can you see the shell underneath? We sometimes find empty cicada shells, don&#8217;t we? It looks like this little guy didn&#8217;t quite make it out.  <span id="more-5933"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5935" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>A few minutes later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Mum, I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s dead after all. He&#8217;s moving!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5936" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada3.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: You&#8217;re right! He&#8217;s pulling himself up to the tree now, and I think those wings are getting bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5937" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada4.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Now his whole body has come out of the shell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Wow, look how his abdomen curls out like that. It really IS weird and cool. You were right.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I know.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5938" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada5.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Whoa! Check out his wings!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Are they growing?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: No, I think they are just getting bigger as they are drying out. See how they are wrinkly and curled up? I think they need to be all smooth before he can fly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/backyard-lifecycles/">Butterflies</a> have to wait for their wings to dry before they can fly too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Good thinking. I wonder if all flying insects have to wait for their wings to dry&#8230;?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5939" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada6.jpg" alt="" width="399" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Do you think his wings are ready now Mum?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I don&#8217;t know. I guess we&#8217;ll have to keep watching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5940" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada7.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: He&#8217;s crawling away from his shell now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Maybe he&#8217;s not quite ready for flying yet&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Mr 3: I can get him and &#8220;fly&#8221; him for you if you like</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5 and Me: <strong>NO!!!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5943" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="398" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>An hour later&#8230;</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Dinner time kids. Time to come inside now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: But I want to see him fly away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5942" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada-child2.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: Let&#8217;s take one last photo before the sun sets. Can you see how his wings are much closer to his body now?</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: Before they were out flat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Me: I think he will stay there now until it&#8217;s dark, and fly away in the night.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5941" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/cicada8.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="399" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Miss 5: I&#8217;ll check if he&#8217;s gone in the morning&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">If you have a child who is into bugs, you might like to watch the following 5min documentary snippet from Sir David Attenborough about the life cycle of cicadas in America.  (Stop it at the 4min mark if you aren&#8217;t ready to explain what the male and female adult insects are doing together&#8230;)  In Australia, our cicadas don&#8217;t emerge on mass the same way &#8211; but they are still pretty noisy!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In case you don&#8217;t live in Brisbane&#8217;s northern suburbs, and in case you missed the pics on <a href="http://facebook.com/squigglemum" target="_blank">facebook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/squigglemum" target="_blank">twitter</a>&#8230; yes, my kids were on the front page of the local paper.  I might be slightly biased but I think it&#8217;s a great photo.  Not just because they&#8217;re both smiling and looking at the camera, but because they are swinging from a rope ladder in our backyard.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">I love the headline too: <em>Swing back to good old fun</em>.  Couldn&#8217;t have said it better myself!  Even after receiving lots of lovely new things for Christmas, my kids are still happiest when they are monkeying around freely in the backyard.  This $12 rope ladder has provided hours of priceless fun and is still going strong after a year outside!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">The front page pic is accompanied by a story and photo on page 5 about playscapes.  In the article, Rebekah Hurworth from <a href="http://yourarchitect.com.au/" target="_blank">Your Architect</a> says, &#8220;<em>&#8230; by incorporating sandpits, rockpools, cubby houses, reading areas and outdoor kitchen areas, children can spend hours entertaining themselves outside.</em>&#8221;  If you are interested in natural playscapes, you might also like to read this great pdf <a href="http://www.kidsafensw.org/docs/factsheets/PAU/Natural%20Playspaces%20KL%202011.pdf">fact sheet from Kidsafe</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left"><strong>What do your kids do in the backyard?  And what did YOU do outside as a kid??</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left">PS &#8211; Yes, my kids usually have hats on outside <img src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you do when you open a new bag of rice from the supermarket, only to find it has bugs in it?</p>
<p>A.  Throw it out</p>
<p>B.  Take it back to the supermarket and demand a refund.</p>
<p>C.  Colour it and play with it!<span id="more-5817"></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest way to colour uncooked rice is to put it into a large ziploc bag with a few drops of food colouring.  Seal the bag up, and toss the rice around inside the bag until the colour has been evenly distributed.  Pour the coloured rice out onto a tray and leave until completely dry.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *   *   *</p>
<p style="text-align: center">Since we had so much rice, we coloured four separate lots.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-coloured.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5818" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-coloured.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="599" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">Once the rice had dried, I poured the colours into separate containers ready for play.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">I also spread out a large tablecloth on the floor to assist with cleanup!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-bowls.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5819" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-bowls.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">I gave the kids a tray each, with an assortment of kitchen items including:</p>
<p style="text-align: center">small containers<br />
spoons<br />
cupcake wrappers<br />
egg cartons<br />
plastic cups</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-layers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5820" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-layers.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="601" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">They enjoyed carefully layering different colours&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-mixed.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5821" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-mixed.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="600" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">&#8230;mixing the colours together&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-pouring.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5822" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rice-pouring.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="599" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">&#8230;and pouring til their containers overflowed!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*   *   *   *   *</p>
<p style="text-align: left">This kind of play made a fabulous mess, of course!  The tablecloth on the floor worked wonderfully.  I was able to scoop it all up, and pour the rice back into containers.  The fun of layering different colours could only be enjoyed once, but I didn&#8217;t stop the kids from mixing the colours up.  In fact, I didn&#8217;t interfere with this play at all.  Both my three year old and five year old played independently for an extended period of time quite happily: pouring, mixing, measuring, layering, and talking to each other as they went.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">So all in all, the rice wasn&#8217;t wasted.  We didn&#8217;t eat it, but we had a whole lot of fun playing with it!</p>
