		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-290" title="img_5803" src="http://mysquiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_5803-300x225.jpg" alt="img_5803" width="300" height="225" />I love activities that involve both indoor and outdoor time.  They are great for when it&#8217;s too hot (or too cold) to be outside for very long.</p>
<p>First we upended the crayon box and salvaged all the broken bits.  I removed any labels, and my two year old put her choice of colours into mini patty pan cases.  (You can use regular patty pans but the mini ones work well for mini fingers.)  We put the cases into a mini muffin tray, then into the oven on 180 degrees C.  How long it takes them to melt really depends on the quality and quantity of crayons you are melting, so keep a close eye on them.</p>
<p>While the melted crayons were cooling on the kitchen bench, we ventured outside to collect leaves.  We have a bush commonly found around Brisbane with butterfly shaped leaves.  I encouraged my toddler to find &#8220;matching pairs&#8221; of leaves, and she enjoyed the challenge of finding leaves of a similar size.  We felt the smooth and rough sides of the leaves, and talked about the veins.  Then we headed back inside with them.</p>
<p>Once cool and hard the crayon-melts were ready.  What a delight to peel off the patty pan cases and reveal the swirly rainbow colours!  We placed pairs of leaves (vein side up) under paper and rubbed over them with the flat side of our rainbow crayons to create butterflies.  These crayons aren&#8217;t the best for drawing with, but theyare great for rubbings.  They are perfect for little hands to hold and don&#8217;t leave any scribbly marks as you colour over the edge of the leaves, as normal crayons would.  (The image didn&#8217;t capture the colours well, but you get the idea!)</p>
<p>The end result was a relatively cost-free but busy afternoon spent exploring plants, recycling crayons, and creating art!</p>

<p>We looked at the way water droplets sat like diamonds on leaves.  We hunted for creepy crawlies that came out during a break in the rain.  We found secret hiding places under branches to escape the downpour.  And it was fun!  I had anticipated that we&#8217;d spend 30 minutes or so outside.  An hour and a half later our hungry tummies dragged us back into the house.  Besides, the sun had come out and we were starting to swelter in our raincoats.</p>
<div id="attachment_272" style="width: 160px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-thumbnail wp-image-272" title="img_5773" src="http://mysquiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_5773-150x150.jpg" alt="img_5773" width="150" height="150" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Come and hide with me Mummy!</p></div>
<p>Although I grew up playing lots of rough and tumble outdoor games as a child myself, I am sometimes too precious with my own kids.  It&#8217;s right to keep them out of the sun on hot days, and rug them up in cold weather.  It&#8217;s right to make sure they are playing in a safe place free from obvious hazards.  But it&#8217;s easy to be over-protective and I often I need to just loosen up and let them be kids.  The worst thing that happened today was that they got a little wet.  Big deal!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve always found that the key to getting toddlers to eat anything is to involve them in the process.  The more fun you can make it the better.  I sometimes struggle to get my two year old to eat lettuce, tomato, celery and cucumber &#8211; but eating ears, eyes, a nose and silly hat is a breeze!  Just give your kids a few bits of whatever salad is in your fridge and they are bound to come up with creative facial features.  Cherry tomatoes make great eyes, mushrooms are great for noses, or try capsicum slices for big hoop earrings.  Play with your food!<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-249" title="img_5659" src="http://mysquiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_5659-150x150.jpg" alt="img_5659" width="150" height="150" /></p>

<p>We chose a spot to sit and looked at the world around us before we started drawing.  I expected her to tell me she could see a tree, the car, or maybe even the bird in a nearby branch.  Of course she saw something I hadn&#8217;t even noticed.  &#8220;I see the sun Mummy!  I&#8217;m going to draw the sun,&#8221; she announced.  And she did.  Check out her cool chalk drawing!</p>
<p>It was good to be reminded that my child isn&#8217;t a carbon copy of me.  She sees the world through her own eyes and will view things differently.  And no matter what activity I suggest we do together, she will do it in her own way.</p>
<p>Get outside with your kids and draw all over the driveway.  Scribble on the steps!  Graffiti up the garden path!!  Chalk is cheap, and besides &#8211; it will wash off with the next rain.<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-223" title="img_5652" src="http://mysquiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/img_5652-150x150.jpg" alt="img_5652" width="150" height="150" /></p>

<p>I had to try a few spots before I found a good patch of dirt with worms in residence.  My daughter squealed with delight as I tipped them onto the white tray and she could easily see them move around.  I had expected that she would be a little uncertain about touching the worms, but was surprised to find that she was desperate to pick one up.  We talked first about being gentle with God&#8217;s creatures (I had visions of squished worms&#8230;) and then I showed her how to hold her hands.</p>
<p>The worms kept her attention for quite a long time.  We talked about how they moved, what they felt like, what worms eat, and what eats worms.  Then we carefully returned them back to the hole we dug them from, and washed our hands thoroughly!</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have suggested an afternoon with worms to my toddler, but I&#8217;m glad she suggested it to me.  And I&#8217;m really glad I didn&#8217;t wriggle my way out of it because I would have missed out on something special.  I dare you to dig!  Leave a comment if you do.</p>

It&#8217;s easy to get stuck in a rut, and find you are playing the same games, singing the same songs and baking the same bickies over and over again!  Many of the ideas you&#8217;ll find here are not new, but perhaps they&#8217;ll remind you of something you loved doing as a kid, or refresh your memory on activity you haven&#8217;t tried for a while.  I&#8217;m always encouraged by seeing what other mums do at home on a daily basis with their children, so I hope these ideas are an encouragement to you.</p>
<p>Please leave a comment if you try out one of the activities with your kids!</p>
