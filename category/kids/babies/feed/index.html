		<description><![CDATA[I'm happy to introduce you to the Groovy Gripper!  Basically the Groovy Gripper is a handle you attach to rusks or fruit to stop your child dropping it while eating.  I don't know about you, but we've certainly donated our fair share of rusks to supermarket floors over the years!]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I get approached by a lot of companies about a lot of products for babies and children.  Some of them are big companies, some are small, but I was so surprised to find one request by a mum I know from the playground.  And I have to say &#8211; her product is great!  There&#8217;s something cool about knowing the person behind a product.  I can see the time, love and dedication that has gone into making her idea a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://www.groovygripper.com/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3606" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/groovy_gripper.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to introduce you to the <a href="http://www.groovygripper.com/">Groovy Gripper</a>!  Basically the Groovy Gripper is a handle you attach to rusks or fruit to stop your child dropping it while eating.  I don&#8217;t know about you, but we&#8217;ve certainly donated our fair share of rusks to supermarket floors over the years!  I like that the gripper also has a fork and spoon attachment which you can use as baby transitions to self feeding.  It&#8217;s BPA free, of course, and you can just throw it in the dishwasher!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1667" title="IMG_8100" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_8100-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_8100" width="300" height="225" />I know, I know.  I shouldn’t worry about this one iota.  I shouldn’t need to blog about this.  I’m totally cool with my 12mth old son playing with his big sister’s toys, but I was surprised that I had to remind myself it was ok.  And if I have to remind myself, maybe others need reminding too.</p>
<p>When little girls play with “typically” boys’ toys we smile.  Of course it’s ok for girls to play with trains and trucks!  No internal dialogue required.  But so often, when little boys play with “typically” girls’ toys, we chuckle, make a joke, or at the very least make some comment that lets everyone else know we’re fine with it.  Yeah.  Really we are.</p>
<p>When I see my little boy pushing a toy pram or cuddling a dolly I know he is simply copying things he sees his primary role model do every day.  Me.  It’s not egotistical to say I’m his world right now.  That’s just the way it is.  According to <a href="http://stevebiddulph.com/">Steve Biddulph</a> (author of Raising Boys), when he’s about four he’ll transition to being Daddy’s boy.  But for now he’s living in a woman’s world.  And he has a big sister to boot!  So yes, he will try on beautiful beads, play with my shoes at any opportunity and smother his teddy with kisses.  And I’m fine with it.  Honestly, really I am.</p>
<p>I just hope that one day we won’t all have to remind ourselves that it’s ok.  Boys&#8230; girls&#8230; when they’re little – they’re all just beautiful children and gender stereotypes shouldn’t even enter our thinking as we watch them learn through play.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; Hubby and I are going to hear Steve Biddulph speak on the topic of raising boys next week.  Will let you know what else I learn about being a mum to a son!!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1659 alignleft" title="IMG_7804" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_7804-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_7804" width="300" height="225" />With spring in full swing, now is the perfect time to enjoy being with your kids outdoors.  Here in Queensland winter is already a fading memory and summer will be bearing down on us before we know it.  Lately I have been taking my son’s highchair outside quite often.  Admittedly ours is a fairly simple highchair (small, wooden, and without wheels and whistles) so it’s easy to take upstairs and out into the back yard.  I do know of a few mums who have either picked up second hand highchairs, or purchased something like the easy care <a href="http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/40157918">Ikea Antilop</a> highchairs to serve as outdoor seating for older babies.  If you haven’t thought about using a highchair outside here are 5 good reasons to give it a try!</p>
<ol>
<li>Fresh air is important for babies.  Taking the highchair out is a very low stress way to make sure you get outside together.  There are different sights, smells and sounds in the garden.  (Be careful though.  Even though <a href="http://squigglemum.com/babies/little-ray-sunshin/">sunshine</a> is important for baby&#8217;s development, don&#8217;t put the high chair in the sun as baby can&#8217;t move away if the sun is burning them, and the chair can heat up too.)</li>
<li>When little ones start self feeding, the mess can range from hideous to indescribable!  Eating outside eliminates much of the regular cleanup.</li>
<li>Supervising back yard play is often challenging when you have a baby and a toddler.  Occasionally I sit my son in the highchair outside, and give him a few interesting things (bark, leaves, etc) to fiddle with while I help my toddler with whatever activity or adventure she is in the middle of.</li>
<li>Thanks to the elevation of the highchair baby can get a different view of the yard.  Everyone likes to see things from a different perspective at times.  I find that rather than exploring what is on the ground around him, my son is more interested in birds, trees and clouds when in the highchair.</li>
<li>There are jobs that parents just have to get done outside at times.  Either they get done while baby is asleep, or you have to take bub out with you.  An outdoor highchair can be oh-so-useful while you’re hanging washing, pulling weeds or washing the dog.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, until your baby is actively crawling and getting into mischief, I still think you’re much better off putting them on a bunny rug on the ground.  But if, like me, you have an older bub who you have to keep your eyes on EVERY second because they are into absolutely EVERYTHING absolutely ALL of the time – taking the highchair outside might be a good trick to have up your sleeve.</p>
<p>PS – leaving bub for long periods of time strapped to the highchair outside will not win you any parenting awards.  Just saying.</p>
<p>PPS – leaving the highchair outside for long periods of time without wiping it out will attract ants.  Lots of them.  Just saying that too.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1543" title="IMG_7791" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_7791-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_7791" width="300" height="225" />We&#8217;ve all done a pretty good job in recent years of being sun smart when it comes to our kids.  New research is showing that perhaps we&#8217;ve gone too far the other way though as increasing numbers of babies are being diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency due to lack of exposure to the sun!</p>
<p>You can read more about the importance of vitamin D in this article on the <a href="http://raisingchildren.net.au/articles/vitamin_d.html">Raising Children Network</a>.  The bottom line is, while it is imperative that we still slip, slop, slap and stay out of the sun during the hottest parts of the day, our kids literally need sunlight on their skin for healthy growth and development.</p>
<p>This is easy with toddlers.  They want to be outside burning off energy!  It&#8217;s much more of a challenge with babies though and we all know how easily a bub can burn.  Here are some things you can try to make sure your little ray of sunshine gets a few minutes of the good stuff every day!</p>
<ul>
<li>put a picnic blanket in the yard and read a story in the sunshine</li>
<li>go for an early morning or late afternoon walk with bub in the stroller</li>
<li>take a rocker outside and put baby in the sun while you hang out the washing</li>
<li>set up a hammock so that you and your little one can swing in the sunshine together</li>
<li>take the highchair outside and feed bub there</li>
<li>spend a few minutes exploring the front yard with baby when you collect the mail</li>
<li>sit older bubs directly on the grass and let them feel the leaves, stick, soil and grass around them</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other suggestions for safely getting some sun into baby&#8217;s day?</p>

		<description><![CDATA[On this day, one year ago, my husband and I drove calmly to the maternity ward (again) for me to be induced (again) at 41 weeks (again)...]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1510" title="IMG_4720" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_4720-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4720" width="225" height="300" />On this day, one year ago, I woke up early even though the house was unusually quiet.  I knew my two year old daughter would be wide awake at her Nan and Pa&#8217;s place.  I imagined her pulling on my Dad&#8217;s arm saying, &#8220;Feed the birds, Pa?  Feed the birds?&#8221;  I missed her a little already, and wondered when I&#8217;d see her next.  One day?  Two&#8230;?</p>
<p>On this day, one year ago, my husband and I drove calmly to the maternity ward (again) for me to be induced (again) at 41 weeks (again).  No waters breaking in the middle of the night.  No timing contractions.  No mad-dash to hospital.  Not even a single false alarm.</p>
<p>On this day, one year ago, I listened to other women as they arrived at the birthing suites, laboured and delivered.  I heard their babies cry, and I heard them leave to go to their wards.  All the while I waited for something to kickstart my own labour.  I paced the halls.  We walked laps of the carpark.</p>
<p>On this day, one year ago, with all other options tried, I agreed to the synto drip (again).  But this time I refused the epidural.  An avalanche of contractions descended upon me.  There is no easing you into labour with the drip.</p>
<p>On this day, one year ago, I roared an apology through the wall to the couple in the next suite still in the early stages of labour.  I didn&#8217;t use pain relief but I did use my lungs.</p>
<p>On this day, one year ago, I gave birth to a son.  I learnt that you really can love your second child as much as your first.  I discovered that my little girl really was ready to become a big sister.  And I was reminded (again) that my husband really is an amazing man.</p>
<p>On this day, I remember.  Happy birthday my beautiful boy.  xx</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1442" title="IMG_7697" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/IMG_7697-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_7697" width="300" height="225" />What could be more fun than a day at the beach?!  With Queensland having unseasonably warm weather, we took the kids to the Sunshine Coast for some quality family time.  We all had a wonderful time, but for different reasons.  Here&#8217;s what we did to prepare for our mini-stay and get the most out of our beach trip.</p>
<p>In the week leading up to our beach holiday the kids and I went to the library and borrowed some beachy books.  The best two were probably Magic Beach (Alison Lester) and Looking For Crabs (Bruce Whatley).  Little Miss 3 was delighted at the prospect of investigating rock pools, and determined to find crabs.  Full of optimism I purchased a little bug-finding kit (small net, specimen jars, plastic tweezers) for a couple of dollars and tucked it into the beach bag as a surprise for her.</p>
<p>We knew that a surf beach or crowded swimming beach was not going to be ideal for a baby and crab-hunting toddler, so we chose Shelly Beach instead.  Only a short stroll from the car was the perfect spot.  Shady sand for me, shallow water for the boys to splash in, and rock pools begging to be explored.</p>
<p>Our little boy took to the sea like a fish to water, pardon the cliche.  He had the best time just hanging out with his dad, and they laughed, splashed and played in the knee-deep water happily.  Meanwhile, my daughter and I investigated the rock pools.  She remembered so much from the books we had read, and nattered away about where we should look and what we might find.  I couldn&#8217;t believe it when we actually found hermit crabs!  (Bright as she is, Little Miss 3 is still convinced that they are called &#8220;Kermit&#8221; crabs&#8230;)  We scooped them up gently with her net, put them on a flat rock for photographs, and watched them crawl back to the water.</p>
<p>When her interest in the rock pools began to wane we built a sandcastle.  We decorated it with shells, and dug a tunnel through until our fingers touched.  Then we poured bucketfuls of water into our moat like in Magic Beach.  Again, the amount of story she remembered without prompting surprised even me.  The boys were still happy in the water.</p>
<p>After that I suggested we collect some small shells to take home for craft later on, but all she really wanted to do was dig holes in the sand and pour water into them.  A little voice inside reminded me that she needed time and space to safely explore the beach in her own way too.  So I let her be, and laughed occasionally at her antics while I collected shells.  Still, the boys were in the water &#8211; though they were now starting to resemble prunes!</p>
<p>Eventually we had to drag both kids away from the beach because it was almost dinner time.  The afternoon had passed without a single, &#8220;I&#8217;m hungry&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;m bored&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Can we go now..?&#8221;  Nature is the best playground.  Ever.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1380" title="IMG_7650" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/IMG_7650-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_7650" width="300" height="225" />When it comes to books and babies, there is one tricky question other mums often ask me.  Should we, or shouldn&#8217;t we let babies put books into their mouths?  There really are two schools of thought on this one.</p>
<p><strong>To Eat</strong> &#8211; putting things into their mouths is one of the ways babies explore the world around them.  They especially enjoy &#8220;mouthing&#8221; toys and items they love.  Some people feel that this is an early way for infants to learn to <em><strong>love </strong></em>books.  There are many books available which allow for this&#8230; tough board books, fabric books, even teething books with special tabbed corners or handles.  The downside is that some children may not take care of their books as they get older.</p>
<p><strong>Or Not To Eat</strong> &#8211; even young children can learn boundaries.  They can be taught to touch gently, and that special things are for fingers and not for mouths.  Some people feel that it is vitally important for little ones to learn to <em><strong>respect</strong></em> books.  They make sure books are stored carefully around the home, and teach their children how to handle books.  The downside is that some children may learn books are only for shelves and not develop a sense of ownership.</p>
<p>So, to eat or not to eat?!  That is the question.  There are professionals and parents on both sides of the fence.  In the last week <a href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/2009/08/growing-kids-who-read.html">Christie (of Childhood 101)</a> blogged about book care, and at the same time <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#/CradleFables?ref=ts">Kirsty (of Cradle Fables)</a> posted a facebook pic of her nephew chomping on a favourite book!  Both of these highly regarded ladies love kids and love books.</p>
<p>What are your feelings on this topic?  Are you more concerned about your kids learning to <em><strong>love </strong></em>books, or <em><strong>respect </strong></em>books?  And which ever way you lean, how do you deal with the downside?  Or do you feel the whole issue is a non-issue?!  I&#8217;d love you to share your thoughts (but be nice to each other, ok?!)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1289" title="img_7475" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_7475-300x225.jpg" alt="img_7475" width="300" height="225" />I&#8217;m a big fan of the playpen.  I know some parents feel that limiting a child&#8217;s physical environment is harsh, or even cruel, but I disagree.  I think that planned, independent play in a small, safe area is really important for healthy development.  I also think that playpens are incredibly helpful when you&#8217;ve got a busy little crawler or new walker on your hands.  (Of course, it goes without saying that leaving a child in a playpen all day does not make for a happy child or warrant a mother-of-the-year award!)</p>
<p>I&#8217;d <strong><em>like </em></strong>to write about how we use the playpen&#8230;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to share my thoughts on the importance of kids being able to play on their own for short bursts of time without needing to be &#8220;entertained&#8221; by mum, or the tv, or anyone else.  I&#8217;d like to remind parents that the world is a very big place to a very small child, and sometimes it can be overwhelming.  Children can relax when they have clearly defined boundaries.  I&#8217;d like to reinforce my belief that it&#8217;s good for kids to be limited to just a few toys of mum&#8217;s choosing at times.  In life you can&#8217;t always have everything you want.<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1291" title="img_7586" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_7586-150x150.jpg" alt="img_7586" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to write about how having a playpen means I can pop to the bathroom (which is up a flight of stairs) all by myself, or duck outside to grab the washing.  I&#8217;d like to tell you about how I can move the playpen around so that my little man can safely be in the same room with me while I&#8217;m cooking or crafting (or blogging).</p>
<p>I&#8217;d <strong><em>like </em></strong>to, but I can&#8217;t.  I can&#8217;t because today my little man busted out.  Broke free.  Escaped.  The connectors are completely shattered.  In several places.</p>
<p>Just perfect.  *sigh*</p>
<p>Now how am I going to go to the loo in peace&#8230;?!<img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1292" title="img_7578" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/img_7578-150x150.jpg" alt="img_7578" width="150" height="150" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center">______________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Last week I posted about the <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/unbloggy-bits/">Unbloggy Bits</a> of life, which inspired Kate to start up <a href="http://picklebums.com/2009/08/14/the-perfectly-imperfect-life/">The Perfectly Imperfect Life Challenge</a> on her blog.  If you&#8217;d like to read about other imperfect mums, imperfect homes or imperfect days &#8211; head to Picklebums for a look.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[*sigh*  We're still waiting.  Almost ten months, and still no sign of the first tooth.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1016" title="img_6637" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/img_6637-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6637" width="300" height="225" />*sigh*  We&#8217;re still waiting.  Almost ten months, and still no sign of the first tooth.</p>
<p>My daughter was the same.  I think she got teeth before she walked, but it wouldn&#8217;t have been by much!  In all honesty, it really doesn&#8217;t matter when teeth come through.  My little man eats solids well, and I know that his gums are strong enough to chomp most foods.</p>
<p>As mums we can get ourselves so worked up and worried about when our children reach milestones physically or developmentally.  Most of the time, it doesn&#8217;t matter!  All the fretting in the world won&#8217;t hurry the arrival of my son&#8217;s teeth.  Kids smile when they&#8217;re ready, crawl when they&#8217;re ready, walk when they&#8217;re ready, talk when they&#8217;re ready and toilet train when they&#8217;re ready.  I say celebrate each milestone, regardless of when your kids reach it!  Don&#8217;t be embarrassed if they walk early or worried if they teeth late.</p>
<p>We all do life at our own pace.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be boring if our children did exactly the same things at exactly the same time?!  When mothers get together we inevitably share news about what our kids are up to.  Instead of feeling bad that someone else&#8217;s kid is doing something before yours, think of it as an opportunity to learn from that mum!  Ask her questions about what has worked for her, and more importantly what <em>hasn&#8217;t</em>.  We are all better mothers when we share the journey together.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; thanks to all the mums who have shared tips and advice with me about teething, solids and pain relief for grumpy bubs!</p>
