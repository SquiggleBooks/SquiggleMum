<p>I had to try a few spots before I found a good patch of dirt with worms in residence.  My daughter squealed with delight as I tipped them onto the white tray and she could easily see them move around.  I had expected that she would be a little uncertain about touching the worms, but was surprised to find that she was desperate to pick one up.  We talked first about being gentle with God&#8217;s creatures (I had visions of squished worms&#8230;) and then I showed her how to hold her hands.</p>
<p>The worms kept her attention for quite a long time.  We talked about how they moved, what they felt like, what worms eat, and what eats worms.  Then we carefully returned them back to the hole we dug them from, and washed our hands thoroughly!</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have suggested an afternoon with worms to my toddler, but I&#8217;m glad she suggested it to me.  And I&#8217;m really glad I didn&#8217;t wriggle my way out of it because I would have missed out on something special.  I dare you to dig!  Leave a comment if you do.</p>

Suddenly she has discovered that any object can be whatever you want it to be, if you just pretend. She likes to use the word &#8220;pretend&#8221; as well, just to make sure we aren&#8217;t confused. This morning she said, &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to the pretend shops with my pretend baby to get some pretend garlic bread. Is that ok my pretend Mummy?&#8221; I was amused until she got to the &#8220;pretend Mummy&#8221; bit!</p>
<p>I remember playing pretend like this when I was a little girl. There are a lot of advantages to being a fabricated mother. Pretend mums get to change pretend nappies that don&#8217;t smell. Pretend mums get to burp pretend babies that don&#8217;t spit up. Pretend mums effortlessly cook delicious meals that everyone eats. And they don&#8217;t have to clean up the pretend dishes afterwards. Pretend mums are perfect and have perfect babies in perfect homes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a real Mum. Despite my best efforts the house is untidy, my toddler is a strong-willed pocket rocket, and dinner is whatever I could throw together while juggling a fussy baby. But I wouldn&#8217;t trade it. While being a mother is more challenging than I anticipated, it&#8217;s also better than I imagined. Real mums get real laughs and real love a real lot.</p>
<p>I have to say though&#8230; tomorrow I think I&#8217;ll take a pretend holiday with all the pretend money I earn being a full-time mum!</p>

Just as I thought about what a lovely moment it was, the happy bubble burst. My two year old came over to me, put her hands on my stomach and said, &#8220;Stop wobbling!&#8221;</p>
<p>I vaguely remember having a flat stomach. That was two kids ago and things will never be the same again! But I do know they will improve with time and exercise, so I decided to go back to my postnatal physio class.</p>
<p>Both kids come with me to class, and while I do situps with baby boy on my lap, my toddler works out beside me! I feel great doing something for myself. I can be so busy trying to be &#8216;all things to all people&#8217; that it&#8217;s easy to neglect me. I know that prioritising myself and my wellbeing is a good example to set for my kids. They will never learn to look after their bodies and value themselves if I don&#8217;t model it for them.</p>
<p>I still have a way to go with my jelly belly. I haven&#8217;t made it out of maternity shorts yet, and at the park last week I got stuck on the slide! I just remind myself that I grew a whole human being inside me not that long ago. I&#8217;m not a big woman, and that&#8217;s a big deal.</p>
<p>(NB:  this is a very tired looking me at 37 weeks.  It takes a while to bounce back from a belly that protrudes like this!  I didn&#8217;t give birth until 41wks&#8230;)</p>

I don&#8217;t like to waver too much because it&#8217;s confusing for a toddler. And I really dislike changing my mind once I&#8217;ve decided.</p>
<p>Last week I decided that my daughter didn&#8217;t really need the bedrail on the side of her bed anymore. It&#8217;s been over a year since she moved into a &#8220;big girl bed&#8221; and she&#8217;s never once fallen out. It was such a small bedrail anyway that we weren&#8217;t sure it had ever been effective anyway. So, off it came. The first night she was upset that it was gone, but she slept fine. The second night she fell out. I raced upstairs to scoop her up, cuddle her, reassure her and tuck her back in bed. I also did this the next night when I heard the same thud. I felt bad that she&#8217;d fallen out not once but twice, but I knew that two falls didn&#8217;t warrant the return of the bedrail. (I did put a blanket and pillow on the floor beside her to cushion her landing though). The fourth time she fell out that week I started to wonder if I&#8217;d done the wrong thing. My husband still thought I&#8217;d made the right call though so I stuck with it. Then she fell out twice in one night, bringing the total to seven. By that stage I was really second guessing my decision!</p>
<p>We always try to do the right thing by our kids as parents. Sometimes short term pain for long term gain is what is required. We immunise our kids, even though we know the needles will hurt, because it will prevent them from diseases. We make them try new veggies, even though we know they&#8217;ll spit them out, because we understand the importance of a healthy diet. And in our case, we let them fall out of bed a few times, even though they&#8217;ll get some bumps and bruises, so that they can learn to stay in it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a few nights now since she&#8217;s tumbled out of bed. In the end I decided that reinstating the bedrail would be a backwards step, and I acknowledged that the whole ordeal was probably more upsetting for me than for her! I&#8217;m glad I stuck to my guns on this one. I have a sneaking suspicion that there will be other tricky decisions in her future that will challenge me more than the bedrail, and they&#8217;ll probably hurt more too.</p>

		<p>The kids and I went to a posh children&#8217;s store yesterday to check out their sale. We had only just stepped through the door when my daughter announced with a giggle, &#8220;Mummy, my pants are falling down.&#8221; She was not the least bit embarrassed but I was mortified as her cute little denim shorts plummeted to the shop floor. I pulled them back up to her waist and held them there until we were safely behind a bookcase where I could investigate the problem.</p>
<p>It was soon apparent that my curious toddler had been fiddling with the buttons inside her shorts, and undone the elastic on the adjustable waistband. I managed to catch one end of the elastic before it disappeared, but the other end was nowhere to be seen, lost inside a tunnel of denim. If we had been at home I would have taken the shorts off her and used something long and skinny to retrieve the elastic, but of course I couldn&#8217;t do either of these things. All I could do was crouch down (with a baby strapped to my front) and use my fingers to push, poke, pull and wriggle the lost end back to the safety of a button.</p>
<p>It took quite a while, and by the time I finally caught the end of the elastic I was frustrated, my back ached and my fingers hurt. My toddler looked at me, put her hand on my shoulder and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry Mum. It&#8217;s no big deal.&#8221; Out of the mouths of babes. I was so frazzled and I wasn&#8217;t even the one with my pants down. Kids have a wonderful way of putting things back into perspective.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I love watching my children when they are wrapped up in the simple joy of discovering something new. My three month old has found his feet this week – literally! He&#8217;s just worked out that there&#8217;s something attached to the bottom of his legs, and his feet are the most amazing things he&#8217;s seen yet. Any time he&#8217;s on his back, he delights in putting his tootsies up in the air so that he can get a good look at them. And at 2 ½, my toddler is revelling in new discoveries and soaks up new information like a sponge. Today we stood out on the front deck together watching a storm approach. As the first big drops of rain hit she said, &#8220;Mummy, I smell something delicious!&#8221; What a delightful way to describe the smell of rain. The only new thing I&#8217;ve discovered this week is that fly spray sets off smoke alarms if you spray it too close.</p>
<p>In this new year I hope I can recapture that simple joy of a new discovery I so often see in my kids. I hope I learn something new about myself, something new about my God, and something new about the world around me. I hope I am brave enough to try a new activity or learn a new skill. And I hope that at least once this year, my face lights up like my daughter&#8217;s does when she smells rain, or touches a starfish, or tastes a fresh strawberry, or when my son looks at his feet&#8230;</p>

I noticed last Christmas that tinsel seemed to be on the way out, and this year all the designer Christmas trees are tinsel-free. I decided to follow the trend, but I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to pack the tinsel away in a box so instead I casually tossed it under the tree to cover the base.</p>
<p>My 2 ½ year old is right into Christmas this year, and loves singing along with carols. She likes a particular kids&#8217; song which says there are &#8220;a million miles of tinsel wrapped around our Christmas tree&#8230;&#8221; This explains why every day the tinsel from beneath our tree mysteriously climbed up from the base and wound its way around the lower branches! To her, it just wasn&#8217;t Christmas without tinsel. (Pic is of her putting tinsel on the tree as a baby &#8211; I should have known.)  I conceded defeat, and wove the tinsel back through our already decorated tree. </p>
<p>It made me wonder which things I can&#8217;t bear to be without at Christmas time. I could say it just isn&#8217;t Christmas without Mum&#8217;s homemade Turkish delight. I could say it just isn&#8217;t the same without leaving the tree lights on all night on Christmas Eve. I could say it just isn&#8217;t Christmas without being woken up at 5am by an excited toddler. But really – it just isn&#8217;t Christmas without Jesus. Those other things are important, but without Him Christmas wouldn&#8217;t exist in the first place. One day Mum won&#8217;t be around to make the Turkish delight, and my kids will grow up and want to sleep in on Christmas Day. Jesus will still be the reason for the season.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Christmas Day tomorrow. We have a huge day planned which will be full of family, food and fun with our kids. It could be easy to go to church in the morning and not give the real meaning of Christmas another thought. But this year, each time I see tinsel on a tree, I&#8217;m going to remember that there&#8217;s only one thing I can&#8217;t do without at Christmas time, or any time. It just isn&#8217;t the same without Him.</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-122" title="img_4974" src="http://mysquiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/img_4974-300x225.jpg" alt="img_4974" width="300" height="225" />Summer has arrived. The sun is up early (as are the kids), the days are humid, and cicadas chirp on into the night. On hot afternoons my toddler loves to sit out on the front verandah and wash spoons. I set her up with a big bowl of cold washing up water, a tea towel, and every plastic spoon we own. She always has a delightful time &#8220;cleaning&#8221; the spoons for me, and ends up soaking wet!</p>
<p>Today the poor kid couldn&#8217;t do anything right. She was just into everything and most of my sentences seemed to start with, &#8220;NO&#8230;.!&#8221; She&#8217;d been quiet out on the verandah with her spoons – too quiet. When I looked to see what she was doing my first reaction was to rouse on her, but then I saw her face. She was smiling innocently, and was so proud of herself. &#8220;I&#8217;m helping you Mummy,&#8221; she said. She had taken all the underwear off the airing racks and was giving them an &#8220;extra clean&#8221; in her dishwashing water! I took a deep breath and instead of yelling, thanked her for her thoughtfulness and helped her to squeeze the water out.</p>
<p>Life is certainly trying with toddlers, even when they&#8217;re trying hard. I think as mums we need to be able to look past their actions to see their intentions. Often their heart is in the right place and they are genuinely trying to please us, even if they don&#8217;t do things quite the way we&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>Our reactions can also leave a lasting impression. In praising my daughter today instead of rousing, I hope I sent the message that I appreciated her help and the initiative she showed. Perhaps it will mean that in the future she&#8217;ll be happy to wash a pile of dirty dishes, or clothes, without being asked. Just not in the same water!</p>

		<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-109 alignleft" title="img_3766" src="http://mysquiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_3766-225x300.jpg" alt="img_3766" width="225" height="300" />My daughter is going to be a flower girl on Saturday, so we headed off on a mission to find gold sandals to go with her gorgeous dress. Unfortunately she was less than impressed about trying on multiple pairs of shoes, and it didn&#8217;t take long before she announced her need for a trip to the toilet. I sighed, hid the most promising pair of shoes under the rack, put her own shoes back on and dragged her out of the store. The toilets of course were miles away, and when we got there she didn&#8217;t need to go any more. I made her sit there until she did something! By then the baby was crying and we all wanted to go home, but there was no way I was leaving without gold sandals.</p>
<p>As we headed back to the shoes, we passed a donut stand. Without hesitation I did something out of the ordinary and stopped to order a donut. A big one. With Icing. And sprinkles. I knew it was blatant bribery but I didn&#8217;t care. That donut was my ticket out of the shops.</p>
<p>We returned to shoe shopping with the donut bag sitting temptingly on the pram. I assured my daughter that she could eat the donut when we got home if she was helpful with trying on shoes, and did what she was asked. I also made it clear that I would very much enjoy the donut myself if she chose not to cooperate. We got the job done eventually, but I really had to hold that donut over her little head. In the end we shared it. She had tried hard, but I didn&#8217;t want her to think her performance warranted the whole donut!</p>
<p>I wondered as I drove home whether I had sunk to a pathetic low with my parenting skills, or whether I had been quite clever. Is bribery always inappropriate, or can it be a useful strategy if carefully managed? Perhaps the frequency with which it is used is significant. If I used it as a strategy too often it would lose impact, and besides &#8211; I don&#8217;t want my kids to think they will always get a reward for doing what is expected of them. On a rare occasion however, I think it works , well&#8230; a treat.</p>
<p>What do you think&#8230;? I&#8217;d love your comments.</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-159" title="img_4040" src="http://mysquiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/img_4040-300x225.jpg" alt="img_4040" width="300" height="225" />My husband played skirmish today. It&#8217;s a highly dignified sport whereby grown men run around shooting each other with paint pellets. He came home grinning from ear to ear, despite the fact that he was totally covered in angry red welts from where he&#8217;d been &#8220;shot&#8221;. He told me that he&#8217;d been on the front line, so he&#8217;d had to take a few hits for the team. Most of the welts will be covered by his business shirt on Monday, but there&#8217;ll be no disguising the bruiser on his chin!</p>
<p>While he was playing skirmish, I was engaged in a battle of my own: a battle of wills. It&#8217;s a highly dignified sport whereby a small child challenges a grown woman on, well, everything. My toddler tried my patience, tested my limits, pushed the boundaries I set, and tried to convince me that she knew best all day.</p>
<p>By the end of the day I felt like my husband looked. I too, had been on the front line, taking hits for the team. I too, had been required to cop it on the chin. I didn&#8217;t have physical marks, but I was emotionally black and blue.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s tough parenting a toddler. You have to hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst. I&#8217;m learning that it takes a lot of determination to wake up every day with a positive attitude, leaving yesterday&#8217;s battles behind. It takes courage to stand firm while they poke and prod and push. And it takes mercy and grace to calmly end each day, assuring them that you love them regardless of their behaviour.</p>
<p>Oh, and on the really trying days (like today), it also takes the listening ear of a mum-friend, a big bowl of icecream and a long, hot bath.</p>
