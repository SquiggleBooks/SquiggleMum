				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Mr5 starts full time school in just a few weeks, and he is <em><strong>so</strong></em> excited about wearing his new uniform and school shoes. We were recently treated to a complimentary pair of kids&#8217; shoes from <a href="http://www.bettskids.com.au/">Betts Kids</a>, so I took the opportunity to check out their <a href="http://www.bettskids.com.au/collection/?category=246&amp;erp_collection=1040">school shoe range</a>.<span id="more-6523"></span></p>
<p>Kids wear school shoes for about 1600 hours each year, so although I usually opt for cheap and cheerful when it comes to kids&#8217; shoes, I prefer to only buy one good quality pair of school shoes per year (if possible) and allow a budget of around $100.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/betts-girl-fitting.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6646 aligncenter" alt="betts girl fitting" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/betts-girl-fitting-682x1024.jpg" width="362" height="544" /></a></p>
<p>Here are my tips for school shoes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get in early. The longer you leave it, the longer the queue will be that you have to wait in. With kids.</li>
<li>Get school shoes professionally fitted. It doesn&#8217;t cost any extra.</li>
<li>Go for good quality leather. Leather breathes and lasts well. With regular polishing, scuff marks are easily taken care of. The old fashioned polish with a brush is much more effective than the roll on type.</li>
<li>Look for a sole with surrounding edge. Younger kids spend a lot of time sitting on the floor (and on concrete!) and the edge will protect the shoe from constant scraping.</li>
<li>Kids have to be able to get their own shoes on and off, so opt for velcro for little ones. Most schools allow velcro for at least the first two years of schooling. If your child is graduating to shoe laces, make sure they have had time to practise during the holidays.</li>
<li>Let them walk around the store in their new shoes. Or jump. Whatever. Let your child wear the new shoes in around the house in the week before school too.</li>
<li>Name them. &#8216;Nuff said.</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s the thing about free play: it requires very, very little. <strong>Children who are good at free play know how to make their own fun.</strong> They don&#8217;t need an adult to provide them with toys. They don&#8217;t need an adult to outline the rules. They don&#8217;t need an adult to explain the process. They don&#8217;t need an adult at all really! Free play can happen any time, any where, with whatever is around.<span id="more-6191"></span></p>
<p>My favourite memory from our recent trip to Far North Queensland was an afternoon spent on the beach at Cape Tribulation. Cape Trib is across the Daintree River by barge, as far north as you can drive in a regular vehicle. It&#8217;s literally the end of the road, though it feels more like the edge of the world. So beautiful.</p>
<p>With no toys and no plans, the kids enjoyed an afternoon of free play with only the things they found on the beach. Here&#8217;s what they did:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6194" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/capetrib-collect.jpeg" alt="" width="400" height="600" /></a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have previously shared some thoughts about <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/climbing-trees/">children and risk</a>, both here on the blog and <a href="http://96five.com">on air</a>. And when my daughter knocked herself out by <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/activities-outdoor/climbing-up-and-falling-down/">falling while tree climbing</a> &#8211; my opinion was challenged, but ultimately unchanged.</p>
<p>While I am happy to share my perspective as an educator and a mother, I am not a child psychologist myself, so I was delighted to be able to interview <a href="http://www.pathwayshrc.com.au/about-us/professor-paula-barrett/">Dr Paula Barrett</a> about this topic.  Here are her thoughts on the risky business of childhood.<span id="more-6139"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6142" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/kids-risk-.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></a>(Yes, my kids are playing with sticks&#8230;!)</p>
<p><strong>Paula, why is it important for children to be allowed to take risks in their play?</strong></p>
<p>There are several reasons but mainly because children learn and gain resilience through challenging experiences. If a child only ever does things within their comfort zone, where they completely understand all the potential outcomes, they don’t learn how to deal with not always achieving the right result or potential disappointment, which is extremely important in later life. Children learn the most when they are challenged.</p>
<p><strong>As parents, how do we know what is reasonable risk, and what is dangerous? </strong></p>
<p>Risk needs to be determined dependant on the particular child and what is developmentally appropriate. For example, a very young child may be able to climb a tree but doesn’t actually yet have the muscle strength for a successful climb – which can result in a dangerous situation. It is very useful to listen to your support networks to help guide you on this, such as grandparents who have great experience and parents with kids of a similar age as they may have dealt with similar situations.  There are also other networks you can rely on who have studied in this area, for example, child care workers, sport coaches etc – they can often make a valuable contribution to your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Have today&#8217;s parents become too risk averse?  Why do you think this has happened?</strong></p>
<p>There are so many reasons for this but I think the main ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Parents are more isolated when bringing up children than they used to be. Involving your support networks can help you better evaluate risk by including those with experience, like grandparents or parents with kids of similar ages.</li>
<li>There are just so many rules – which are good in that they protect society at large however they can also inhibit children to take risk.</li>
<li>Kids time today is increasingly over-structured with too many scheduled activities &#8211; which minimises the opportunities children to be challenged outside of being told what to do.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What should we do to encourage children who are not natural risk takers?</strong></p>
<p>A great way to encourage children who are not natural risk takers is to help them form friendships with children who are.</p>
<p>And, as parents you can reassure them through modelling the behaviour– go outside with them and get involved.  You can try a step plan where you encourage them to face challenging situations in small steps – maybe once a week or once a fortnight, only moving them to the next step when they are ready.  It helps to reward them but not with things that you buy – it is more powerful to dedicate time to something that they love doing e.g. take them to the beach or build a cubby house with them.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any evidence to suggest that encouraging kids to take risks in play might lead to risky behaviour later in life? </strong></p>
<p>No, there is none at all! Children taking risks during play build self-confidence, whereas developing good judgement or self-regulation is another issue all together. Risk taking in adulthood is more about personality and life choices.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> _______________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Many thanks to Dr Paula Barrett for answering my questions about kids and risk, and the team from MILO for arranging the interview. I am proud to be a MILO Play Ambassador!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://livinglocurto.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5904" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Morning_cards-livinglocurto.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" /></a><em></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">The start of the day can be harrowing, especially if you have kids of different ages who need to get to different places!  The only way I know of getting everyone out of the door on time and with everything they need, is to establish good routines and stick to them.  Routine charts can be incredibly helpful for a child&#8217;s growing independence.  Young kids who can manage a few steps independently in the morning, become kids who are responsible for their own school materials, and then become teens who are capable of managing their own timetables.</p>
<p><span id="more-5901"></span></p>
<p>I chatted with Liam, Robbie and Jo on air this morning about routine charts on Brisbane&#8217;s 96Five.  If you missed it, check out the <a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=11331">podcast</a>!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://96five.com/pages/content.aspx?pid=11331"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5902" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/96five.gif" alt="" width="223" height="168" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Summary points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#8217;t confuse reward charts with routine charts</li>
<li>Move from photographs, to pictorial symbols, to words and symbols, then finally to timetables</li>
<li>Keep it age appropriate (a 4 year old can probably manage a 4 step morning routine&#8230; a 6 year old can manage 6 steps)</li>
<li>Remember that the aim is independence! Let them be responsible for their tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three ways to go about starting off a new routine chart for your child.  You can make it yourself from scratch, use one that others find works for them, or buy a ready-made one.  The advantage of making your own is that you can truly personalise it for your child.  Photos are especially effective for young kids.  Take a photo of the breakfast cereal, the kindy bag, the school uniform, the sunscreen&#8230; whatever!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to use a routine chart from other mums, try one of these:</p>

<p>This week on air with <em>The Family Show</em> on <a href="http://96five.com">96five </a>I spoke about birthday parties, and shared my top tips for hassle-free parties.  If you missed it, here&#8217;s a summary for you:<span id="more-5248"></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Invitation etiquette usually becomes an issue at school age. Either limit the party to 2 or 3 &#8220;special friends&#8221;, or invite all of the girls/boys in the class, or invite everyone!</li>
<li>As well as stating a start time, include a finish time.  Two hours is usually long enough for a kids&#8217; party.  Let parents know whether you would like them to stay for the duration of the party, and if siblings are invited.</li>
<li>Go for activities rather than games, especially for younger children. Three year olds will be engaged for much longer with playdough than with a pinata.</li>
<li>Try not to leave yourself with too much to DO during the party. You want to celebrate with your child.</li>
<li>Keep party bags simple!</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the reason I was talking about parties was because my big girl turned FIVE!  She has been planning her rainbow birthday party for a looong time and it was so delightful to see her share the occasion with all of the girls from her prep class.  Here are a few colourful shots of the party:</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do your children like to dance? Mine do.  This morning we twirled and whirled in tutus together &#8211; yes, I put one on too.  My daughter asked for &#8220;dancing music&#8221; so I flicked through the CD collection until I settled on one.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose <a href="http://squigglemum.com/win/ukulele-baby-wiggle-squiggle-giveaway/">The Wiggles</a>, even though Dorothy rather considers herself a dino-ballerina.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/justine-clarke-in-concert/">Justine Clarke</a>, even though she&#8217;s hands down my favourite children&#8217;s entertainer.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t choose a Playschool album, or a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/kids/dear-jimmy-giggle/">Jimmy Giggle</a> album, or any other children&#8217;s album.</p>
<p>So what DID I choose?<span id="more-5088"></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing4.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5090" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing4.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="600" /></a></p>
<p><em>Haydn, Rimsky-Korsakov, Schubert, Tchaikovsky </em>and <em>Grieg</em>.  Yes, classical orchestral music by some of the world&#8217;s best composers.  Despite my love for good qualitychildren&#8217;s music, I fear that at times we do our kids a disservice by not exposing them to music beyond this.  It is valuable for little ears to hear different sounds from different places and different times.  Rock music, classical music, folk music, jazz music, choral music and more.  (Of course there is much adult music that is inappropriate for children so you may need to check any lyrics before you push play!)</p>
<p>I spent many hours rehearsing and playing in orchestras myself as a child and as a teenager, and I still enjoy cranking up the volume of a great piece every now and then.  I can&#8217;t expect my kids to enjoy classical, or jazz (which I also love) with me if I never give them the opportunity to listen to it.  Or dance to it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing_collage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5091" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/dancing_collage.jpg" alt="" width="604" height="304" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>Which genres of music do you enjoy, </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong><em>and do your kids listen, sing or dance along too?</em></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I need to be upfront and tell you that Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com/art-not-craft-the-process-of-learning-creatively-ebook/">Childhood101</a> and I aren&#8217;t just blogging colleagues &#8211; we&#8217;re friends.*  And when I say I like her ebook &#8211; I mean I <em>love </em>it.  So much so that I contributed a few photos, helped with editing and I am a proud <a href="//www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585&quot; target=&quot;ejejcsingle&quot;&gt;Click here to view more details&lt;/a&gt;">affiliate</a>.  (That means if you purchase the ebook because I said it&#8217;s awesome, I get a percentage of the profits too.)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5071" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/artnotcraft_300x250-banner.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is it?</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="//www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585&quot; target=&quot;ejejcsingle&quot;&gt;Click here to view more details&lt;/a&gt;"><em>ART not Craft</em></a></strong> is a downloadable, 53 page ebook in a pdf format.  Instead of buying a paper-and-cover book, you purchase an ebook and either print it out, or read it on the screen.  It is in full colour and contains lots of great photos of young children in action with a variety of mediums.</p>
<p><strong>How much is it?</strong></p>
<p>Using an e-format keeps overheads low, so you can purchase it for <strong>$15.95</strong> (<em>and </em>you get a bonus gift).  If you could book an early childhood consultant to sit down over coffee while you pick her brain about all-things-art, it would cost a fortune!  This book is kind of like that.  Oh, except Christie is totally a tea drinker&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>What&#8217;s in it?<a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/artnotcraft-photos.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5076" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/artnotcraft-photos.jpg" alt="" width="250" height="251" /></a></strong></p>
<p>Loads of information on <em>why </em>we approach art in the early years the way we do, and great ideas for you to try.  <em><strong>ART not Craft</strong></em> is broken into sections on drawing, painting, printmaking, collage and sculpture.  Christie gives suggestions throughout for learning, doing, seeing, and talking with your child as you go.  It is a resource you will go back to many times.</p>
<p><strong>Who should buy it?</strong></p>
<p>If you have ever given your child a blob of playdough, or put a paintbrush into their hand and thought, &#8220;Now what&#8230;?!&#8221; &#8211; this is a book for you!  Many parents want to be creative with their kids, and want to provide creative learning opportunities, but just don&#8217;t know where to start.  It&#8217;s also a great resource for anyone working with under fives.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><strong>When asked to comment on the book, here&#8217;s what I had to say:</strong><em><em> </em></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em><em>&#8220;Children are inherently creative, and are capable of doing so  much more than merely copying simple crafts.  In this ebook Christie  opens up a world of possibilities for you to explore with your child, or  with a whole class of young children. I highly recommend <strong>Art Not  Craft</strong> to parents and educators who are looking to provide rich,  creative and artistic opportunities for the children in their care.&#8221;<br />
</em></em></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5073" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/artnotcraft_359x86-banner.jpg" alt="" width="359" height="86" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<p>BONUS!  Purchase <em><strong><a href="//www.e-junkie.com/ecom/gb.php?ii=914733&amp;c=ib&amp;aff=164233&amp;cl=114585&quot; target=&quot;ejejcsingle&quot;&gt;Click here to view more details&lt;/a&gt;">Art Not Craft: The Process of Learning Creatively</a></strong></em> <em>and you will receive ‘A Wish For All Children’ poster as a  downloadable, easy to print A4 PDF. Hang it in your home to inspire and  remind you of the importance of children making art.</em></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/boy_cleanup_truck.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4968" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/boy_cleanup_truck.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">My son surprises me constantly because he thinks so differently to me. When I asked him to sweep up the cornflakes he spilled on the floor recently, he ran off to his toybox to find a truck.  Just as I was about to rouse on him for going to play instead of cleaning the mess &#8211; I realised what he was doing.  <span id="more-4967"></span>He swept the cornflakes into the dustpan, tipped the dustpan into the dump truck, drove the truck over to the bin, and emptied out the contents!</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Instead of being cross at him, we all laughed and I took a quick photo.  For me it was a moment of learning.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Sometimes in my impatience I step in too early.  And if I&#8217;m honest, perhaps I also assume my children will do things <em><strong>my</strong></em> way.  I say that I want to raise the kids to be independent, to be good problem solvers and to be creative.  But I wonder if my actions speak louder than my words.  Am I actually communicating completely the opposite?  I have to give my children the time, space and opportunity to do things <em><strong>their </strong></em>way.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Even if it means cleaning the floor with a dump truck.</p>
