		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I might have been born in Victoria, but I am a Queenslander at heart.  Just for the next few weeks though I wish I was down south!  Over the coming weeks, major libraries around Melbourne will host a  series of special ‘<em>Babies Love Books</em>’ events as part of the State Government’s $2.1  million <a href="http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/learn/reading-literacy/young-readers-program">Young Readers Program</a>.  Now in its second year, the <a href="http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/learn/reading-literacy/young-readers-program">Young Readers Program</a> has distributed free  ‘<em>It&#8217;s Rhyme Time</em>’ booklets and DVDs to parents of over 200,000 babies and toddlers.  The program aims to reach 500,000  children by  2011, and to assist in fostering a love of books for life,  linking the  relationship between literacy and the health and wellbeing  of future  generations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alisonlester.net/">Alison Lester</a>, multi-award winning, best selling and much loved children’s author and  illustrator is an ambassador for the program. Her picture books mix imaginary worlds with everyday life,  encouraging children to believe in themselves and celebrate the  differences that make them special.  If you live in Victoria you can meet Alison Lester  this month at the events listed below.  But if, like me, you are elsewhere in the country, you&#8217;ll have to be content to read my interview with Alison Lester:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/alison_lester_books.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3504" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/alison_lester_books.jpg" alt="" width="404" height="404" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Cath </strong>- When should parents begin reading aloud to their kids, and what can they do to make the most of read-aloud time?</p>
<p><strong>Alison </strong>- I think you should start reading to babies from the word go, or maybe even before. Lazing around reading when you’re pregnant must be very good for babies. To make the most of reading time it’s good to take it slow and cuddly. Always get as close to horizontal as you can.</p>
<p><strong>Cath </strong>- What do you recommend parents look for when selecting picture books for young children?</p>
<p><strong>Alison </strong>- I shouldn’t say this, being an author, but I don’t really think it matters what you read them as long as you do it well. Children will always let you know if they think a book is a dud.</p>
<p><strong>Cath </strong>- Many of your picture books are firm favourites with Australian children and adults alike.  As a mother my pick is <em>Magic Beach</em>.  As a teacher my favourite would be <em>Imagine</em>.  Do you have a favourite?</p>
<p><strong>Alison </strong>- It’s a bit like having to say which one of your kids you like the best. They are all special in different ways. I love <em>Are We There Yet?</em> because it reminds me of the happy time we had on that trip.</p>
<p><strong>Cath </strong>- As an author/illustrator, do the words come first, images first, or does the book evolve as a whole for you?</p>
<p><strong>Alison</strong> &#8211; When I have an idea for a book I can generally see it then, as a whole, the style of illustration, the font, the shape and size. The next step is some rough illustrations in a dummy book and then I put the text into my computer.</p>
<p><strong>Cath </strong>- You’ve spent a lot of time travelling the country visiting schools, particularly in remote areas.  Why has this been important to you?</p>
<p><strong>Alison </strong>- I started visiting schools about 30 years ago, just because they asked me really. Now I can see that those school visits did a lot to get my books out into the world. I love going to remote communities and working with the kids and teachers there. I always get a huge kick out of seeing a class make a book about their own stories, told in their words and their pictures.</p>

<p>In the fifth edition of Literacy Lava, you’ll find ideas  for helping kids develop spelling skills, ways to pair fiction and  non-fiction read-alouds, ideas for letter writing with your kids,  whether graphic novels are real reading, how to unwrap a picture book,  tips for a loving bed-time story ritual, how to help your video-loving  kid to love reading too, and all about encouraging kids to write poetry.  Don’t forget to check out the Online Extras page, and the Activity page  for kids.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a snippet from my article on Unwrapping Picture Books.</p>
<div><em>What do you do when you receive a beautifully wrapped gift? I look at the shape, feel its size and weight, try to get a clue from the wrapping paper about where it was purchased and check for hints on the ribbon &#8211; all in an attempt to work out what is inside! Somehow by taking my time opening the present, the contents are just that bit more exciting. A picture book is like a beautifully wrapped gift. Discerning readers can discover clues about the content if they know where to look. Here’s how to help your little detective unwrap a story&#8230;</em></div>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>At a recent trip to the nursery I spotted a plant I had been eyeing off for a while heavily marked down.  Something had been nibbling on one of its large, ornamental leaves but apart from that it was fine.  What I didn&#8217;t realise was that I would be bringing the very-hungry-something home with us!  The next day I noticed the second of the plant&#8217;s large leaves eaten, and by the following day the plant was almost annihilated!  I decided it was time for some detective work, and wasn&#8217;t really surprised to find a huge caterpillar tucked out of view down inside a stalk.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/caterpillar_brisbane.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2757" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/caterpillar_brisbane.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="384" /></a></p>
<p>The kids and I retrieved the sneaky culprit and put him in a box for further investigation.  We talked about the caterpillar&#8217;s colour and markings.  We watched the way it moved.  We took note of its size and the funny &#8220;tail&#8221; at the end.  We talked about what colour butterfly it might turn into and wondered how we could find out&#8230;?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through">So then we pulled down an enyclopedia.</span> Oh hang on, no &#8211; that&#8217;s not what we did.  We googled it.  Here&#8217;s how I guided Little Miss 3 through an internet search:</p>
<p><em>Me:  We want to find more information.  <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> can help us find information.  What information do we want to find?</em></p>
<p><em>LM3:  We want to find out about what our caterpillar will turn into.</em></p>
<p><em>Me:  That&#8217;s a lot of words.  Can you tell me one word?  We want to know about&#8230;?</em></p>
<p><em>LM3:  Caterpillars</em></p>
<p><em>Me:  Ok, let&#8217;s type c-a-t-e-r-p-i-l-l-a-r-s.  That says caterpillars.</em></p>
<p><em>LM3:  That sure is a big word Mum!</em></p>
<p><em>Me:  Do we want to know about AAALLLL the caterpillars in the world?  Or just the caterpillars where we live?</em></p>
<p><em>LM3:  Just where we live.</em></p>
<p><em>Me:  And where do we live?  In B&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>LM3:  Brisbane!</em></p>
<p><em>Me:  Ok, let&#8217;s type B-r-i-s-b-a-n-e.  There.  So now we&#8217;re asking Google (point) to tell us information about caterpillars (point to word) in Brisbane (point to word).  Can you click here?</em></p>
<p><strong>I&#8217;m not fussed on young kids playing heaps of computer games, but I think there is a lot of value to be had in early, purposeful use of technology.</strong></p>
<p>We found a couple of useful sites and looked at various pictures of caterpillars to identify our own.  There was so much fantastic language involved in this process as we eliminated images.  <em>Too green.  Too spotty.  Too hairy!</em> Once we found some caterpillars that were similar we could look at more subtle detail like the four yellow spots, and the funny &#8220;tail&#8221;.  Eventually we found a match&#8230; we think!  Our best guess is that our very hungry caterpillar will become a Hawk Moth&#8230;</p>
<p>My daughter enthusiastically took her caterpillar to kindy today and shared her new found knowledge with her classmates.</p>
<p>We love learning together.  Did you learn something with your kids today?</p>

<p>We had just finished reading her kindy library book for the week, <em>Do Like A Duck Does </em>(by Judy Hindley)<em>.</em> The toy phone rang so I &#8220;answered&#8221; it and pretended it was the mother duck calling.  I improvised conversation based on the text, which went something like this:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Hello Mummy speaking.  Oh hello Mrs Duck.  How&#8217;s your day been?&#8230; What&#8217;s that?!  You took the children for a walk and a fox tagged along?!  Goodness me!  What did you do? &#8230; (giggle)  And you made him quack?  And eat worms?!&#8230;</em><em>(giggle)  Well, it sounds like you taught him a lesson.  I&#8217;m glad it all worked out in the end.  Bye for now!&#8221;</em></p>
<p>Of course, my daughter had completely dissolved into hysterics by the end of the conversation and wanted to have a turn too.  The pretend phone rang again and she proceeded to have a similar conversation with Mrs Duck.</p>
<p>The following day she wanted to play phones again.  Building on the success of the day before, I took things a step further:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Hello Mummy speaking.  Mr Fox you sound terrible.  What&#8217;s happened?  Oh dear, you tried to trick Mother Duck? </em><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/do-like-a-duck-does.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2695" title="do like a duck does" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/do-like-a-duck-does.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="178" /></a><em>You know she&#8217;s very clever and doesn&#8217;t like anyone messing with her babies&#8230; I understand you&#8217;re hungry.  How about you go and dry yourself off and make some nice soup instead?&#8230; Ok, I hope you feel better soon.  Bye bye.&#8221;</em></p>
<p>What a powerful tool for helping a child to see different perspectives on the same story.</p>

		<p>As an educator I have always had two loves: music and literacy.  I majored in music, but could never bring myself to become a music specialist because I knew it would mean giving up the opportunity to help children fall in love with language!  As a mother, it naturally follows that there is much music in my kids&#8217; world.  We sing as we work, we sing as we play, we sing during bath time and while we&#8217;re driving in the car.  We sing with others at church and sometimes even use a microphone.  We sing serious songs, silly songs, story telling songs and our own made up songs.  And I have found it  fascinating to watch my children&#8217;s language development through song.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/roo_hungrycaterpillar.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2625" title="roo_hungrycaterpillar" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/roo_hungrycaterpillar.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="384" /></a>My son is 17 months old, and currently says these words (probably only a mother would even call them &#8220;words&#8221;):</p>
<p>dadad = Dad</p>
<p>gagga = cracker</p>
<p>nana = banana</p>
<p>ga = car or grapes</p>
<p>gigga = digger</p>
<p>mumum = Mum (this is pretty rare to be honest)</p>
<p>I realise that this selection of words makes my son seem like a stereotypical boy (food and cars)!  My point is that his speech is still at a <em>very </em>early stage.  However, <strong>the vocabulary he has through song far exceeds his spoken words</strong>.  He can&#8217;t quite say grapes (ga), but as we passed the huge melons in the supermarket the other day he started swaying from side to side tunefully babbling something that sounded incredibly like, &#8220;I love, you love, watermelon!&#8221; (a Justine Clarke song we often sing at home).  He does the same thing when we read Saturday&#8217;s page in <em>The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em>.  As soon as he sees the picture of the slice of watermelon he sways from side to side and tunefully babbles, &#8220;I love, you love&#8230;&#8221; all over again.</p>
<p>There is so much going on that little brain!  Not only is he is learning new vocab but he is making connections between objects and experiences, remembering words in sequence, understanding that words are made up of sounds, having a red-hot-go at forming those sounds with his own mouth, communicating his thoughts with others, and enjoying the whole process!  I didn&#8217;t sit him down with a watermelon flash card.  I just sang with him.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Lil_sing_outside.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-2630" title="Lil_sing_outside" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Lil_sing_outside.jpg" alt="" width="288" height="384" /></a>My daughter is almost 4.  She recently started kindy, but was home with me full time before then and has heard a <strong>lot</strong> of songs.  At this stage she can read (and write) her own name, and recognise personally significant letters and their associated sounds &#8211; but that&#8217;s about it.  She certainly isn&#8217;t &#8220;reading&#8221; yet.  However, her ability to recall lyrics is amazing.  This means that before she can even read she has developed her skills in recall and sequencing.  It also means she has an excellent vocabulary for her age, and she transfers words from songs into everyday conversation.</p>
<p>Like many preschoolers she loves to make up her own songs, and has done for some time.  Her songs are quite varied and interesting both musically and lyrically.  Sometimes she sings her own made up story.  Sometimes she sings about feelings.  Sometimes she sings about what she can see.  Often her songs demonstrate her understanding of story structure, rhythm, phrasing, and even rhyme (much to my amusement she sometimes makes up a word so that her lines rhyme as she sings).  Before she starts formal schooling she already has such a good foundation under her &#8211; through song.</p>
<p>There are many ways music and literacy complement each other, and several studies have proven these connections.  Learn to sing, and sing to learn I say!  If you&#8217;re interested in further information on this topic, try the work of Robert A. Cutietta, author of <em>Raising Musical Kids: a guide for parents </em>(2001)<em>.</em> Cutietta claims the patterns of words, rhymes, and tonal qualities inherent in songs are incorporated easily and naturally by children as they learn to speak and eventually to read.  Based on what I see in my own children &#8211; I completely agree.</p>
<p><strong>Singing with your kids is bound to boost their language development.  How well you sing is unimportant.  How often you sing <em>is</em>.</strong> So to quote The Carpenters (which I can&#8217;t <em>believe </em>I&#8217;m doing)&#8230; &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry that it&#8217;s not good enough, for anyone else to hear.  Just sing, sing a song&#8230; la la la la la&#8230;&#8221;</p>

		<p>If you&#8217;re a parent with young kids, and you&#8217;re interested in raising readers &#8211; you&#8217;ll definitely want to check this out.  <a href="http://www.susanstephenson.com.au/Literacy_Lava_files/Literacy%20Lava%204%20final.pdf">Literacy Lava</a> is a FREE publication put together by Susan Stephensen (aka <a href="http://www.thebookchook.com/">The Book Chook</a>) and a bunch of teachers, writers, bloggers and literacy advocates.  I have contributed an article on <em>Book Loving Boys</em> to this issue, full of practical suggestions for reading aloud with boys under 5.  (There&#8217;s also a super cute photo of the two men in my life reading together.)</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/LL4-cover.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2560 alignleft" title="LL4 cover" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/LL4-cover.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="320" /></a><em> </em></p>
<p><em>In this fourth edition of Literacy Lava, you’ll find ideas for nurturing creative thinking, ways to use magazines with your kids, ideas for raising book-loving boys, what to do if your child is not into writing, how to encourage your child to love reading, ways to promote inquisitiveness through hands-on learning, how to help kids make connections through story extensions, and all about getting kids to tell stories through moviemaking. Don’t forget to check out the Online Extras page, and the Activity page for kids.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;d love you to go and <a href="http://www.susanstephenson.com.au/Literacy_Lava_files/Literacy%20Lava%204%20final.pdf">download your own copy</a>.  Read it on the screen, or print it off if you like and read it over a cuppa!  I really enjoyed many of the articles in Literacy Lava 4 and I know it will be a useful resource for parents, teachers, aunts &amp; uncles, grandparents and carers.  Happy reading (for you and your kids)!</p>

<p>Backyard baking is so much fun.  Props required?  A bowl and maybe a large spoon.  Your child might need a little encouragement to get started, but after that they will run with the activity for quite some time.  If you have cooked with your child they will probably take to this activity more readily.  Here are some open ended questions you can use to help the activity along if necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What are you baking today?</em></li>
<li><em>What ingredient will you need next?</em></li>
<li><em>How much of that ingredient will you need?</em></li>
<li><em>What will you do with your mixture?</em></li>
<li><em>How do you know when it&#8217;s ready?</em></li>
<li><em>What does it taste like?!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you establish some ground rules, especially if there is anything in the garden unsafe for your child to pick (be wary of plants with milky white sap).  My daughter decided to make &#8220;Weed Soup&#8221; for her recipe.  She picked leaves and flowers from weeds, and also added macadamia nuts, bark and a range of other different leaves.  She sang &#8220;Stir up the cooking oh deedle-deedle-dum&#8230;&#8221; (a <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/children/play/default.htm">Playschool</a> cooking song) while she worked and served the soup up in plastic cups when it was ready!</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/weed_soup2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2505" title="weed_soup2" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/weed_soup2.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="324" /></a></p>
<p>For an extension on this activity you could encourage your child to write down their &#8220;recipe&#8221; when they&#8217;re finished.  A simple recording of their recipe only involves writing a title at the top for them, and allowing them to draw their ingredients.  For slightly older children you can label their ingredients under each picture.  If your kids love this activity why not make a recipe book and glue in each different recipe?!</p>

		<p>January might as well be called Slimming Season.  Marketing campaigns for dieting companies and products go into overdrive, cashing in on our holiday guilt.  I for one feel NO guilt about enjoying special foods at Christmas or about taking the pressure off myself in the kitchen during the holidays.  This doesn&#8217;t mean my daughter is immune from the marketing messages though.  &#8220;New year, new you&#8221; type campaigns are all over the tv, and meal replacement bars and shakes are in the supermarket aisles!!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2280" title="IMG_9341" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/IMG_9341-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_9341" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p>This week we borrowed &#8220;Rosie &#8211; the Cow Who Wanted to Slim&#8221; from the library by Christel Desmoinaux.  What a timely book and wonderful way to combat the current media assault without making too much of a big deal about it all.  Rosie is a gorgeous cow with plump pink udders.  She makes good milk which makes good cakes and life is good.  That is, until she reads Moo Monthly and discovers she&#8217;s a little, well, heavier than the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">covergirls</span> covercows.  Her highly successful slimming campaign results in a svelte figure, but at the cost of her milk. I think there&#8217;s a message in that for mums <em>and </em>daughters, don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2281" title="rosie_slim" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rosie_slim-300x300.jpg" alt="rosie_slim" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got older girls in your family, this would be an excellent book for a big sister, older cousin or young aunty to read to your daughter.  Our girls need to hear the real truth about body image, and they need to hear it more loudly and more clearly than the messages they get from the media.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>I think it&#8217;s so important that we choose appropriate books for our kids.  Appropriate in terms of content, length, language and more.  But I also believe it&#8217;s important to stretch our kids a little.  It&#8217;s easy to fall into the trap of only buying and borrowing &#8220;toddler&#8221; books right up until formal schooling starts!  Don&#8217;t get me wrong&#8230; I&#8217;m not saying we should read novels to young children.  Eek!  But I am saying that we need to make sure our kids are increasingly exposed to stories with quality sentence structure and broader vocabulary as they grow.</p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to go with an area of interest for your child.  As they get older they will do this naturally.  Regular SquiggleMum readers will know that I&#8217;m a bird nerd, and my kids are too.  So this week my three year old borrowed two wonderful picturebooks from the library about birds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-2082" title="bird_books" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/bird_books-300x225.jpg" alt="bird_books" width="300" height="225" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>Birds Build Nests</em> (written by Yvonne Winer and illustrated by Tony Oliver)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><em>King of the Birds</em> (written and illustrated by Helen Ward)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">Both contain language which is a bit more of a stretch for my daughter, but she has just loved them.  <em>Birds Build Nests</em> is written in verse, with each stanza describing a different type of nest.  In this book she has come across words such as tranquil, rookeries, abandoned, silhouetted, etched, fledgelings, tailors, intricate, russett, delicate, craggy, predators, secure, camouflaged, tundra and more!  These aren&#8217;t words a toddler typically encounters, but my daughter coped with them because they are well supported by the illustrations, and they relate to an area of personal interest to her.  In our (several) readings of this book we have talked about many of these new words, though I did not stop and explain each new word to her as we read unless she particularly asked.</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2083" title="birdnest_coll" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/birdnest_coll.jpg" alt="birdnest_coll" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><em>King of the Birds</em> is a retelling of an old folktale which we have read over, and over again.  It reads beautifully, and while some words have been new again for my daughter she has understood remarkably well.  Because the topic is of special interest to her she has coped with sentences like: &#8220;<em>The struggling broad-bellied birds, the fluttering finches and sparrows, the lazy flap of gulls and slim-winged sea crossers, the busy wings of auks and the invisible beats of hummingbirds all rose higher&#8230; and higher, a column of birds circling up to the sky.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2084" title="birdking_coll" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/birdking_coll.jpg" alt="birdking_coll" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p>And on top of all this rich language, both books include identification guides at the end of the text.  My daughter and I have pored over these pages &#8211; looking up names of birds unfamiliar to us, comparing eggs, finding Australian birds and learning about habits of different species.  Of course I have not read these pages in their entirety to my daughter &#8211; she&#8217;s only 3!  But they have prompted wonderful conversations and I have been able to pick out facts to share with her.</p>
<p>What piques your child&#8217;s interest?  Is it insects?  Trucks?  Space?  Dinosaurs?  Dolphins?  Use their interest area as an opportunity to take them further with language.  And yes, that might mean you need to learn a thing or two about velociraptors or black holes or ornithology&#8230;</p>
<p>Happy reading!!</p>

		<p>On the weekend my kids and I went to a wild rumpus in the park hosted by <a href="http://www.cradlefables.com/">Cradle Fables</a>.  We roared our terrible roars and gnashed our terrible teeth and rolled our terrible eyes and showed our terrible claws.</p>
<p>The wild rumpus was of course inspired by Maurice Sendak&#8217;s classic picture book <em>Where The Wild Things Are</em>.  The story which has enchanted generations of children is about to be released as a feature film, sparking renewed interest in the tale.  I remember having this story read to me as a child, I have studied it with students and now have the privilege of sharing it with my own children.  Here are my little wild things listening to the story at the rumpus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1971" title="wild_things2" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/wild_things2.jpg" alt="wild_things2" width="404" height="404" /></p>
<p>While the book appears simple, containing in fact only ten sentences, it is actually a very deep story.  Here are my thoughts on how you can help your little ones to get the most out of this remarkable picture book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read it slowly.  I usually find I need to read this story more slowly than some other books, partly to give my child time to process and partly because many sentences run over several pages.</li>
<li>Read it emotively.  Toddlers need your emotion behind the words to help them understand the context.</li>
<li>Read it dramatically.  There are lots of opportunities to interact with the book.  Roll your eyes, gnash your teeth, stare your toddler down, use your face to show what loneliness feels like.  Boys especially need this physical interaction with the text.</li>
<li>Understand the subtext.  This is actually a book about anger.  Mum sends Max to his room for stirring up trouble, and while in time out he processes his frustrations through imaginative role play.  The resolution comes in his understanding and acceptance of his mother&#8217;s loving discipline.  Obviously that&#8217;s an adult explanation of the text and not one you would share with a child (!!) but understanding the subtext may help you to connect the book to your own child&#8217;s experiences.  Have they been sent to time out?  When they are angry does their face look like Max&#8217;s?  Do they know that someone loves them best of all, even when they mess up?</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t worry too much.  Some parents are concerned about the scariness of the story, and worry that their child may not sleep well.  I have shared this book with many, many children and my experience has always been positive.  Even though the wild things are a little scary looking, Max is always in control and readers usually identify with Max.</li>
<li>Leave your child questioning!  Most children will be quick to realise that Max has been imagining &#8211; or has he?  Check out the moon at the start and the end of the book&#8230;</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy reading!!  ROOAARRRRRR!</p>
