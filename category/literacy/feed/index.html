				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I started blogging as SquiggleMum in 2008, with an eight week old baby in my arms and a toddler under my feet. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, but with two school aged kids and a busy life offline &#8211; I&#8217;m finally ready to let go of SquiggleMum. Well, the mum part anyway. <span id="more-6843"></span></p>
<p>I rarely write about parenting these days, and I feel that stories of my children&#8217;s adventures (or misadventures as the case may be) aren&#8217;t for me to share anymore. So I&#8217;m making a new home online, at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">squigglebooks.com</a></p>
<p><a href="http://squigglebooks.com"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-6844" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/squigglebooks-logo1.png" alt="squigglebooks logo1" width="500" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://squigglebooks.com">SquiggleBooks</a> you&#8217;ll find a mix of book reviews, posts about children&#8217;s literacy, thoughts about education, and tips for teachers. You&#8217;ll also be able to keep up with the latest news about my own writing career, and definitely be among the first to know <del>if</del> when I land that elusive picture book contract. It&#8217;s a pretty basic site for now, but I expect it will grow and change just as this blog has.</p>
<p>Before I go, I&#8217;d like to thank a bunch of people who have been part of the SquiggleMum journey. There have been thousands of comments on the blog over the years &#8211; <em>thank you</em> to each of you who took time to connect here. Some readers have become friends &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for staying in touch and encouraging me along the way. I have been privileged to write for a number of other parenting sites and share parenting advice on air &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for having me.  I have also won several awards and been invited to speak about blogging at conferences &#8211; <em>thank you</em> for the opportunity. Thank you to the bloggers who have been with me since the beginning &#8211; especially Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.com">Childhood101</a>, as well as Kate from <a href="http://picklebums.com">Picklebums</a>, and Kelly from <a href="http://beafunmum.com/">Be A Fun Mum</a>. (There are too many others to name!)</p>
<p>I hope that many of you will join me in this next chapter&#8230;</p>
<h2>Blessings,</h2>
<h2>Cath / SquiggleMum.</h2>

<p><strong>Author/</strong><strong>Illustrator</strong>:  <a href="http://www.christinesharp.com/">Christine Sharp</a></p>
<p><strong>Publisher</strong>: <a href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/book.aspx/1319/Sylvia">UQPress</a></p>
<p><span id="more-6810"></span><a href="http://www.newfrontier.com.au/"><strong style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;">SquiggleMum&#8217;s comments</strong><span style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;">:</span><img style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;" title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /></a></p>
<p><em></em>As soon as I heard about <strong><em>S</em><em>ylvia,</em> </strong>I couldn&#8217;t wait to get my hands on this delightful picture book. Sylvia the Snail is in love with Simon the Gardener &#8211; or at least his produce. She pines for his parsley and peas, and thinks his spinach and strawberries are scrumptious. Sadly, the feeling is not mutual, at least in the beginning.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sylvia-snail-image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6812" alt="Sylvia snail image" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Sylvia-snail-image.jpg" width="591" height="464" /></a></p>
<p>Early childhood educators will love <em><strong>Sylvia</strong></em>. The story ties in nicely with Sustainability (a cross-curricula priority in the Australian Curriculum) and any unit about growth and living things. The text is full of rich vocabulary (<em>luscious, scrumptious, defeated, smitten, persistence, salute&#8230;</em>) and I am a big fan of texts which embrace interesting descriptive language instead of shying away from it. Strong alliteration features throughout, and will be easy for young readers to identify.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">The illustrations are delicious, and I especially like the way readers can see above and below the ground. The changing point of view between Sylvia&#8217;s perspective and Simon&#8217;s is very well done, and the juxtaposition of the two perspectives on the opening spread makes for a wonderful beginning. Also worth discussing with students here is the way Sharp has given equal size, and therefore importance, to both characters. </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">UQPress always do a great job with their </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/store/images/Hi-RES/teachersnotes/1319/3435.pdf">teacher&#8217;s notes</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, and these ones are well worth downloading (although I would love to see direct links with Outcomes). </span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">My only criticism of this picture book is the inclusion of the tiny plane as I would have preferred something more organic in the narrative resolution. It&#8217;s only a small comment though, and doesn&#8217;t stop <em><strong>Sylvia</strong></em> from being an early childhood text I highly recommend. </span></p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Childhood / Lower Primary</li>
<li>Classroom reading</li>
<li>Discussing new vocabulary</li>
<li>Introducing alliteration</li>
<li>Discussing text positioning</li>

<p><span id="more-6799"></span>When Mum announces there will be a surprise at dinner, two little boys let their imaginations run wild as they consider what it could be. Crinkly chips? A swimming pool? A trip to Hawaii&#8230;? Throughout the story, the underlying question is &#8220;What does it mean to be lucky?&#8221;</p>
<p><img title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /><em><strong>Lucky</strong></em> is a visual feast. David Mackintosh has a signature mixed media style, and readers of all ages will enjoy exploring the wild illustrations. It could also be useful for discussing visual literacy techniques in the classroom, including framing, text positioning, colour, reading path and salience.</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lucky-elephant-image.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-6804" alt="lucky elephant image" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/lucky-elephant-image-1024x652.jpg" width="604" height="384" /></a></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">My personal opinion is that the strength of Mackintosh&#8217;s work is in the illustrations rather than the text, and while I don&#8217;t warm to the narrative &#8211; I can certainly appreciate the art. </span></p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mixed ages (can be useful during school holidays!)</li>
<li>Discussing visual literacy techniques</li>
<li>Discussing mixed media</li>

<p><img title="More..." alt="" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-includes/js/tinymce/plugins/wordpress/img/trans.gif" /><em><strong>Look and See</strong></em> is great for beginning readers. My five year old has just started on home readers, and was able to independently read it after hearing it a couple of times. The text contains a great percentage of easily recognised high frequency words (&#8220;sight words&#8221;) which will help beginners to experience early success. The rhyme structure also assists with text prediction.</p>
<p>Author/Illustrator Shane Morgan is a descendent of the Yorta Yorta peoples of Victoria. His cheeky illustrations will get a giggle out of young readers.</p>

<p><span id="more-6771"></span>I&#8217;ve met Pam several times at SCBWI meetings in Brisbane, and caught up with her recently at the <a href="http://www.squigglemum.com/writer/cya-success-again/">CYA Conference</a>. Although I don&#8217;t usually review novels, I made an exception for this one as I was interested in using it for an English Unit I&#8217;ve been writing.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><em><strong>The Ratcatcher&#8217;s Daughter</strong></em> is a great read. The story is narrated by Issy, a thirteen year old girl living in Brisbane in 1900. When the Black Death touches not only her town, but her family, Issy steps up to take her father&#8217;s job eradicating plague-carrying rats. </span></p>
<p>This novel deals with life and death, and also tackles underlying issues of class and gender stereotypes &#8211; tying in perfectly with the Australian History Curriculum. I particularly enjoyed the references to newspapers throughout the text, and in the the inclusion of newspaper clippings in the appendix. These provide an opportunity for teachers to discuss the moral, ethical and social dilemmas encountered in propaganda, and also allow for comparison with current media.</p>
<p><em><strong>The Ratcatcher&#8217;s Daughter</strong></em> is one to order for your school library, and you&#8217;ll probably want multiple copies if your school is in Brisbane.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Upper Primary classrooms</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Novel study</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Exploring character</span></li>
<li>Historical fiction</li>
<li>Brisbane local history</li>

<p>&#8220;This book is about a boy getting bullied every day on the school bus. When I read it I could feel what it&#8217;s like to be bullied. I felt like the main character was me. I hope this book teaches kids not to bully each other. The words in <em><strong>Bully on the Bus</strong></em> are so interesting, and the way it&#8217;s all in poems draws you in. The shape of the poems makes you think about the meaning. Once I started I had to finish the whole story.&#8221; (Miss 8)</p>

<p><em></em>Kat is a dear writing friend and colleague of mine. Maybe I cried when reading <strong><em>Bully on the Bus</em> </strong>because I know the author &#8211; but I suspect it has more to do with her incredible storytelling and poignant touch. (The last sentence on p91 really got me&#8230;)</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Teachers will love the verse novel format. Yes, verse novel. (<a href="http://uqp.uq.edu.au/skins/uqp/_uploads/samplechapter/Bully%20on%20the%20Bus_Sample_Chapter.pdf">See this link for an example of the layout</a>). Rather than being broken into chapters, each section is a poem which stands alone, yet contributes to the narrative. Poems are in free verse, and cleverly shaped to reflect the content. The poetry is easy to read because it&#8217;s not too abstract, but at the same time provides an early introduction to poetic devices and figurative language. </span></p>
<p>The comprehensive <a href="http://www.uqp.uq.edu.au/store/images/Hi-RES/teachersnotes/1297/3322.pdf">teacher&#8217;s notes</a> are aligned with the Australian English Curriculum, and well worth downloading if you are an educator. The examples of poetic devices on specific pages will be useful for teachers (although I think metaphor features more heavily than is mentioned here), and I was pleased to see reference even to peritexts such as the dedication page. An excellent resource.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recommend <em><strong>Bully on the Bus</strong></em> highly enough. As a teacher, a mother and a writer this one gets my tick of approval.</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lower Primary / Middle Primary classrooms</li>
<li>Exploring poetic forms (including shape poems)</li>
<li>Exploring poetic devices (including metaphor, simile and alliteration)</li>
<li>Family reading</li>
<li>Bullying theme</li>
</ul>

<p><em></em>There is a lot to like about <strong><em>Edward</em><em> and The Great Discovery,</em> </strong>the first picture book by New Frontier&#8217;s current Commissioning Editor.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Edward is the youngest in a long line of archaeologists &#8211; and he is yet to make his first big discovery. When he uncovers an unusual egg, he is disappointed to find that only a bird hatches out. Worse still, it is a bird that can&#8217;t fly. On a trip to the museum he realises of course that his bird is an extinct Dodo, which makes it a great discovery after all. Along the way he also discovers some truths about himself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/edward-opening-layout.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-6740" alt="edward opening layout" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/edward-opening-layout.jpg" width="600" height="344" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Edward and the Great Discovery</strong></em><strong> </strong>includes some beautiful illustrations, and the first opening of the stairwell and family photo gallery is a stand out. The cover is brilliantly executed and the endpapers are a delight. In fact, these two elements are probably the book&#8217;s best features. However, I think the italicised words <em>emphasised</em> on almost every opening are a little heavy handed, and in my opinion the entire last page is probably unnecessary. (I would have preferred a more open ending, allowing readers to consider for themselves what Edward had discovered in addition to the Dodo.)</p>
<p>The Teachers&#8217; Notes provided by New Frontier are disappointing and offer very little to educators so I have not included the link here. This is unfortunate as the book has some obvious curriculum connections.</p>
<p>All up, a beautifully presented book which families will enjoy sharing together.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended for</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Early Childhood / Lower Primary</li>
<li>Family reading</li>
<li>Museum excursions</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I&#8217;ve read lots of Rainbow Magic Fairies books, so when I heard about the Wilderness Fairies I was very interested. I was hoping that these books by Jodie Wells-Slowgrove would be a bit more interesting (because the Rainbow Magic books are ALL the same)!</span></p>
<p>I was right. The Wilderness Fairies books are much more interesting and I really enjoyed them. In the first book, Daisy&#8217;s Quest, we meet Daisy and a lot of other Australian creatures that help her on her quest to find her wings. In the second book, Daisy learns how to use them. Wings are more troublesome than she expects.</p>
<p>I found these books easy to read. The pictures helped me to understand what was going on. I really liked the setting because I know about the Australian bush. I think 7-9 year olds will enjoy the series. There are some great colouring pages at the <a href="http://www.wildernessfairies.com/">Wilderness Fairies website</a>. I can&#8217;t wait for books three and four!</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Recommended for</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>kids who like the Rainbow Magic series</li>
<li>easy chapter books</li>
<li>discussing the Australian bush</li>
</ul>
