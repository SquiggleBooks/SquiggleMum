<p>Everybody&#8217;s talking about it&#8230; this issue with keeping up the juggling act.  We&#8217;re all talking about it because we&#8217;re all struggling with it.  How do we keep all the balls in the air?  How do we juggle life as women, mothers, wives, employers, employees, bloggers&#8230;</p>
<p>Each of us is only one person, and there are only 24 hours in a day.  At the <em><strong>bare </strong></em>minimum we need to sleep for six of those hours (and you and I both know that eight would be better)!  Without stopping to eat we&#8217;d never get through the day, so there go another two hours.  With the hours left there are so many demands on our time.  I spend a lot of time with a lot of mums who confess that they often crash into bed at night, wondering how they&#8217;ll fit all the things they didn&#8217;t get around to doing today, into tomorrow&#8217;s schedule!  And I understand, because I&#8217;m as guilty of it as anyone.</p>
<p><a href="http://picklebums.com/2009/09/20/tricky/">Kate from Picklebums</a> recently wrote about this <a href="http://picklebums.com/2009/09/20/tricky/">Tricky</a> problem, and in the same week a friend and MOPS (<a href="http://mops.org.au">Mothers Of Pre Schoolers</a>) leader posted this on facebook:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1740" title="juggling_karen" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/juggling_karen.png" alt="juggling_karen" width="553" height="59" /></p>
<p>As you can imagine she received many comments.  I started writing my list for you, but deleted it because quite frankly I&#8217;m embarrassed about how long it is.  Another mum from my church who has older kids than I do and is a little further along the road than me pointed me to this article by <a href="http://www.keriwyattkent.com/articles/greenmarkers.htm">Keri Wyatt Kent</a>.  In it she says,</p>
<p><strong><span style="font-family: Verdana;font-size: x-small"><em>A wise friend of mine puts it this way:<br />
“I picture myself juggling a lot of balls. Sometimes, I                          drop a ball. In most cases, that’s not too big of a                          deal. But a few of the balls, like my husband and my                          kids, are glass balls. So I make sure I do whatever it                          takes not to shatter those balls.”</em></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Some of the balls are rubber, and will bounce if we just                          give them a little push now and then. Some are lead and                          just weigh us down and we shouldn’t be trying to juggle                          them in the first place.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Sometimes we have to say “no” to opportunities, to                          requests that other people make. The discipline of                          saying no, and wisdom to know when to say it, is a great                          challenge. </em></strong></p>
<p>When I read that I thought she was speaking to me.  My blog is a rubber ball.  It can bounce back from a few days offline, and nobody&#8217;s world would be shattered if I didn&#8217;t post for a month.  I think housework is a rubber ball too!  I know there are balls made of lead I need to just let go of.  They are not mine to juggle.  But my husband and my kids are my glass balls.  I can&#8217;t drop them.  Ever.  My precious kids need Mummy-time almost as much as they need food to eat, and my husband deserves the best of me, not what&#8217;s left of me at 11:30pm. I&#8217;m so glad I have this visual image now to remind me of the beauty and fragility of relationships.</p>
<p>What are you juggling in your life?</p>
<p>PS &#8211; No judgemental comments.  Especially about the 6hrs sleep thing, ok?  We&#8217;re all just doing our best and trying to work things out&#8230;</p>

		<p>I had the BEST time at the <a href="http://connect2mums.com.au">Connect2Mums</a> Seminar on the Gold Coast over the weekend.  Meeting so many people in real life for the first time, even though I already call them friends, was amazing.  On Saturday afternoon I had the privilege of presenting a workshop on blogging, and loved being able to share what I&#8217;ve learnt with many other mums.  (Yes, I&#8217;ll upload my handouts for you ASAP.)</p>
<p>On Saturday evening we all frocked up for the big awards night.  We stepped out in heels and worked the <span style="text-decoration: line-through">red</span> purple carpet for the photographer.  I was so excited because I already knew I would be receiving the Best Parenting Resource award for this blog.  What I didn&#8217;t know, was that I would be announced as the <em><strong>Top AusMumpreneur for 2009</strong></em>!</p>
<p>I am very, very rarely lost for words.</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1722" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_8334-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_8334" width="300" height="225" />We had a much needed day at home today.  We had time to just <em>be</em>.  Kids need that, and mums do too.  We spent the morning in the backyard making <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/collections-up-clos/">nature collections</a> together, and discovered that half of the collection tray was taken up with interesting seedpods.</p>
<p>It was a wonderfully spontaneous way of talking about life (at a three year old level).  &#8220;A tree grows big and strong.  The tree grows seedpods with little seeds inside.  The wind carries the seeds down to the ground.  The little seed grows into a new tree, big and strong&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>We spent time talking about each one.  Some of them still had seeds in them, some of them had little holes where the seeds would have been.  Some seedpods were huge, and filled with hundreds of seeds.  Some only contained a single seed.  Some were so tiny it was hard to believe there were seeds inside them!</p>
<p>Without doubt though the best part of the morning was talking about how the seeds move around in the wind.  Sure, some fall straight down and land under the tree they came from, but many others are so light and delicate that the slightest breeze carries them away, like the African Tulip seeds (top of seed photo).  We also found seeds from trees not in our yard!  How did they get here?!  Both of my kids were delighted when I showed them how the Tipuana Tipu seeds (at the bottom of our seed photo) spin and whirl like helicopter blades when tossed into the air.  These seedpods are everywhere at the moment, so if you see one on your travels be sure to show your kids how they fly.  They&#8217;re better than any paper plane you could fold and will entertain your kids for ages.  Even my twelve month old got the giggles over these!</p>
<p>Before a gardening guru says it, I know&#8230; both of the species I mentioned are introduced and not ones we actually want to encourage to germinate in our gardens!!  You have to admit that they have fascinating and highly effective methods of seed dispersal though, which is why they are fast becoming recognised as &#8220;weeds&#8221;.  This would make a great discussion if you have older kids.</p>
<p>To make sure we don&#8217;t add to the weed-problem we&#8217;ll just use the seeds for craft <img src="../../../../wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>I was stoked last week to discover I&#8217;d won a writing comp over on Karen&#8217;s blog&#8230; <a href="http://www.miscmum.com/">Miscellaneous Adventures of an Aussie Mum</a>.  And yes, I&#8217;ll admit to doing a little happy dance when the sponsors contacted me to organise delivery of my prize &#8211; an iphone.</p>
<p>I think as parents we all have a responsibility to keep up with current technology.  If we don&#8217;t, our kids will be living in a world we can&#8217;t participate in, can&#8217;t contact them in and worst of all, can&#8217;t keep them safe in.  One day my kids will want to be on facebook, and twitter, and whatever the next thing is, and that&#8217;s ok with me because <em>I&#8217;ll be there already</em>.  Well, I&#8217;ll try to be!</p>
<p>Sometimes I cringe because at only 31 I already feel like just as I get my head around some aspect of technology it all changes, or upgrades, or is replaced by something better.  What will I be like at dealing with current technology in twenty years time?!  Despite this, I know I can&#8217;t stick my head in the sand and pretend that social networking sites, and phones that can do things we&#8217;ve never imagined don&#8217;t exist.  Why?  Because I&#8217;m a mum.  And if those things are going to be part of my children&#8217;s world as they grow up, those things are going to be part of my world too.</p>
<p>So about my new iphone. My three year old can play games on it already.  My twelve month old isn&#8217;t quite there yet &#8211; I need to get him one of <a href="http://www.dinosaursandrobots.com/2009/05/coreys-wooden-iphone-teething-toy.html">these</a> (hehehe).  My hubby is already dabbling in augmented reality and coding for iphones!!</p>
<p>And me?</p>
<p>Yesterday iworked out how to answer it when it rang.  And imanaged to send and receive txts.  If only icould work out how to import my old contacts list!  This weekend I&#8217;ll be at a seminar iwould love to tweet from, but ithink istill have a bit to learn before then.  Anyone got any advice to share on iphones?  Most of all ican&#8217;t find the function that turns my iphone into a little housecleaning robot&#8230;</p>

<p>First of all, a big thank you to the Small Fry Team for allowing me to give away a total of six of their beautiful books.  The winners of the copies of Small Fry Play are Candice and Diana.  Congratulations!  (See below for random.org results)  Ladies I hope the book inspires many happy days spent playing with your kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">_______________________________</p>
<p>The third book in the series by Susie Cameron and Katrina Cook has just been released &#8211; <a href="http://www.smallfryfun.com">Small Fry Play: Inspiration for Creative Play With Kids</a>.  This time the team are joined by early childhood consultant Sue Cant as they explore a topic close to the hearts of teachers and parents alike.</p>
<p>Play is the essence of childhood.  If you ask me childhood almost doesn&#8217;t exist without it!  Through play our children discover so much about the world around them, and their place in it.  With the early years becoming increasingly fast paced, tech-heavy and toy laden, it&#8217;s never been more important to emphasise the value of play.</p>
<p>Even though play is completely natural for kids, they often need a little help to get started or a nudge in the right direction.  <a href="http://www.smallfryfun.com">Small Fry Play</a> is brimming with ideas for parents as we seek to stimulate our children&#8217;s play.  I love the ideas for creating special spaces for kids to play in, both indoors and out.  There are suggestions for props that might assist with make believe play, and even ideas for creating a kid&#8217;s toolkit (yes, with hammers and screwdrivers)!  Experiments are scattered throughout the book, and there are truly gorgeous suggestions for exploring art and music.  The advice on purchasing toys is really smart, and a great read for any parent.  Oh, and I love that the whole book begins with a guide to safe play and tips for setting limits as parents.</p>
<p>Sue Cant&#8217;s hope is that Small Fry Play will &#8220;inspire you to create an environment for your children that is filled with wonder and curiosity, to stimulate their play time and help them achieve their unique potential while having a wonderful time together along the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have two copies of <a href="http://www.smallfryfun.com">Small Fry Play</a> to give away this week, and it&#8217;s your last chance to win a SF book here on SquiggleMum!  To be in the running <strong>leave a comment sharing a play idea</strong>.  It could be a memory from your own childhood, or an activity or game your kids love.  And because it&#8217;s the last of the Small Fry giveaways, you can have a <strong>second entry if you subscribe</strong> to my blog by email or RSS.  Just leave an extra comment saying that you&#8217;ve subscribed, or you&#8217;re an existing subscriber.  The comp is again open to Aussie residents and two winners will be drawn SUNDAY 18th October 6pm Qld time.</p>
<p>Winning results:</p>

<p>When little girls play with “typically” boys’ toys we smile.  Of course it’s ok for girls to play with trains and trucks!  No internal dialogue required.  But so often, when little boys play with “typically” girls’ toys, we chuckle, make a joke, or at the very least make some comment that lets everyone else know we’re fine with it.  Yeah.  Really we are.</p>
<p>When I see my little boy pushing a toy pram or cuddling a dolly I know he is simply copying things he sees his primary role model do every day.  Me.  It’s not egotistical to say I’m his world right now.  That’s just the way it is.  According to <a href="http://stevebiddulph.com/">Steve Biddulph</a> (author of Raising Boys), when he’s about four he’ll transition to being Daddy’s boy.  But for now he’s living in a woman’s world.  And he has a big sister to boot!  So yes, he will try on beautiful beads, play with my shoes at any opportunity and smother his teddy with kisses.  And I’m fine with it.  Honestly, really I am.</p>
<p>I just hope that one day we won’t all have to remind ourselves that it’s ok.  Boys&#8230; girls&#8230; when they’re little – they’re all just beautiful children and gender stereotypes shouldn’t even enter our thinking as we watch them learn through play.</p>
<p>PS &#8211; Hubby and I are going to hear Steve Biddulph speak on the topic of raising boys next week.  Will let you know what else I learn about being a mum to a son!!</p>

<p><em>Celebrity mamas seem to have it all together. They are stylish, their kids are oh-so-cute, their nappy bags are to die for, and if by any chance they have dark circles under their eyes they are covered by makeup or enormous designer sunnies. But I think the hardest part for the rest of us un-super-mums to deal with is their hot bods. Any time a Hollywood mama steps out with a new baby she seems to have instantly bounced back to her pre-pregnancy size and it of course makes the front page of the glossies.</em></p>
<p>Oh, and if you missed my Parenting Australia post last week about toilet training called <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/304-by-my-own-self">By My Own Self</a>, it&#8217;s here too.</p>

		<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-1659 alignleft" title="IMG_7804" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/IMG_7804-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_7804" width="300" height="225" />With spring in full swing, now is the perfect time to enjoy being with your kids outdoors.  Here in Queensland winter is already a fading memory and summer will be bearing down on us before we know it.  Lately I have been taking my son’s highchair outside quite often.  Admittedly ours is a fairly simple highchair (small, wooden, and without wheels and whistles) so it’s easy to take upstairs and out into the back yard.  I do know of a few mums who have either picked up second hand highchairs, or purchased something like the easy care <a href="http://www.ikea.com/au/en/catalog/products/40157918">Ikea Antilop</a> highchairs to serve as outdoor seating for older babies.  If you haven’t thought about using a highchair outside here are 5 good reasons to give it a try!</p>
<ol>
<li>Fresh air is important for babies.  Taking the highchair out is a very low stress way to make sure you get outside together.  There are different sights, smells and sounds in the garden.  (Be careful though.  Even though <a href="http://squigglemum.com/babies/little-ray-sunshin/">sunshine</a> is important for baby&#8217;s development, don&#8217;t put the high chair in the sun as baby can&#8217;t move away if the sun is burning them, and the chair can heat up too.)</li>
<li>When little ones start self feeding, the mess can range from hideous to indescribable!  Eating outside eliminates much of the regular cleanup.</li>
<li>Supervising back yard play is often challenging when you have a baby and a toddler.  Occasionally I sit my son in the highchair outside, and give him a few interesting things (bark, leaves, etc) to fiddle with while I help my toddler with whatever activity or adventure she is in the middle of.</li>
<li>Thanks to the elevation of the highchair baby can get a different view of the yard.  Everyone likes to see things from a different perspective at times.  I find that rather than exploring what is on the ground around him, my son is more interested in birds, trees and clouds when in the highchair.</li>
<li>There are jobs that parents just have to get done outside at times.  Either they get done while baby is asleep, or you have to take bub out with you.  An outdoor highchair can be oh-so-useful while you’re hanging washing, pulling weeds or washing the dog.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, until your baby is actively crawling and getting into mischief, I still think you’re much better off putting them on a bunny rug on the ground.  But if, like me, you have an older bub who you have to keep your eyes on EVERY second because they are into absolutely EVERYTHING absolutely ALL of the time – taking the highchair outside might be a good trick to have up your sleeve.</p>
<p>PS – leaving bub for long periods of time strapped to the highchair outside will not win you any parenting awards.  Just saying.</p>
<p>PPS – leaving the highchair outside for long periods of time without wiping it out will attract ants.  Lots of them.  Just saying that too.</p>

		<p><em><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1645" title="caro_webster_garden" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/caro_webster_garden-300x223.png" alt="caro_webster_garden" width="300" height="223" />“Be careful, there’s a dragon in the back garden…”</em></p>
<p>… So my young daughter told me recently. Off we set, bravely looking for the evidence. And we found it too.  Dragon poo (large palm seeds dropped by a wayward bird), stomped upon plants (the late night frolicking of our puppies) and a mark on the outdoor table &#8211; made by the beating wings of said dragon (remnants of potting mix) were, to my daughter’s mind, irrefutable evidence that a dragon had taken up residence in an average suburban back garden in Sydney.</p>
<p>We spent several hours concocting a truly awesome (and awful) potion to control the antics of this dragon.  An array of objects was harvested from the garden, the laundry and the pantry.  Think washing-up liquid, dog biscuits, food dye, sticks, leaves, soil, bits of carrot, flower petals, the odd sultana and you get a pretty clear picture of the potency of this potion.</p>
<p>What I enjoyed so much about this play session was that <strong>my daughter conceptualized, instigated and managed the entire play process</strong>.  She led it in its entirety. I was a mere passenger on her creative whirligig – and what a fun ride it was!</p>
<p>I <span style="text-decoration: underline">revel</span> in fostering the imagination of a child. Left to explore and discover in an <strong>unstructured</strong> way outside, you can almost hear their beautiful, creative minds whirring with delight as they hop from one thing to another; touching, smelling, crushing, tasting, questioning, listening, chatting &#8211; discovering.  <strong>The positive bond they form with nature by doing this will reap incalculable benefits as they move toward adulthood. </strong></p>
<p>When I wrote Small Fry Outdoors, it was very important to me to share my belief that <strong>imagination can be fostered in the simplest of places </strong>when Mother Nature provides the backdrop.  It doesn’t take huge effort, you need very few props and other than observing commonsense, there need be very few rules.</p>
<p><strong>The best starting place for very young children is their own back garden</strong>.  It doesn’t matter the size.  Whether your ‘personal patch’ is a sprawling urban space, small courtyard, balcony or the expanse of a rural property, there’s fun to be had everywhere – your child just needs to know ‘how’ to look.</p>
<p>Here are some ideas you might like to try to kick start your child’s beautiful imagination:<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1646" title="caro_webster_gumnuts" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/caro_webster_gumnuts-208x300.png" alt="caro_webster_gumnuts" width="208" height="300" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Start a <strong>nature box</strong>.  Encourage your child to look for quirky bits and pieces found in nature and pop them into a box or old cake tin for use in a found collection, nature journal or craft activities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Start a <strong>vegie patch</strong>, or if space is limited try growing plants in an old toy, wooden box or pot plant on a balcony or verandah. To begin with, choose ‘fail safe’ plants such as Rocket, lettuce, pumpkin, tomatoes or marigolds to avoid disappointment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Go hunting for <strong>dragons, fairies and other mystical creatures</strong>.  By mixing the imaginary with the real, your child will be mesmerized.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Take the indoors out</strong>.  Grab a book, some colouring pencils, a tea set, Lego (whatever takes your child’s fancy) and play together in the cool shade of your favourite tree.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Go hunting for some funky stones or pebbles and start a <strong>Pet Rock</strong> collection.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you can manage it, try going for a <strong>walk together every day</strong>.  You’d be surprised just how far little legs can go all the while chatting happily about what they see, hear and smell.</li>
</ul>
