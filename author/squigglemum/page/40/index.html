		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-798" title="Tantrum Tracker" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/tantrum-tracker-300x232.png" alt="Tantrum Tracker" width="300" height="232" />I&#8217;m yet to meet a mum who hasn&#8217;t struggled with tantrums through the toddler years, but some of us seem to have a rougher time with it than others.  My daughter and I have had some really tough days.  She&#8217;s a beautiful-hearted little girl, but she can really turn it on! </p>
<p>At first I told myself that tantrums were not only normal, but to be expected.  After a while though I started to become concerned.  Some days her behaviour was so markedly out of character, and she could deteriorate rapidly seemingly without provocation.  I was beginning to suspect certain foods may have been exacerbating her behaviour, and I knew that I would need to keep records in order to work out what was going on.  I had a quick look online to see if any resources were available to help me do this (no point reinventing the wheel), but didn&#8217;t find anything so set about designing my own.  What can I say, it&#8217;s the teacher in me! </p>
<p>I wanted to know whether tantrums happened on certain days of the week or at certain times of the day.  I wanted to record how long tantrums actually lasted, because one minute of a screaming toddler can seem like ten.  I wanted to work out whether several small tantrums pre-empted a full blown rage.  But most of all I wanted to keep a record of <em>what may have contributed to the tantrum</em>.</p>
<p>If a tantrum came within an hour of eating, I marked (F) for food in the Contributing Factors column and noted what she ate.  Tantrums are common if kids are sick (S), tired (T) or out of routine (R) so I marked those too.  It was important for me to acknowledge that sometimes my parenting (P) decisions contributed to a tantrum.  It can be easy to blame everything else and not look at ourselves!  There were days when I overreacted to typical toddler behaviour.  There were times when I didn&#8217;t give a warning before giving a punishment.  There were situations when my expectations were unrealistic.  My records wouldn&#8217;t have been accurate if I hadn&#8217;t admitted my contributions.</p>
<p>Keeping a printout of the Tantrum Tracker on the fridge meant I could quickly take notes throughout the day.  At the end of the week it was easy to look over and identify any patterns in behaviour.  I started to notice which foods consistently resulted in uncontrollable behaviour and eliminated them.  I also picked up on which parenting strategies were causing me more grief than good, and switched tactics!  Keeping track of my daughter&#8217;s behaviour didn&#8217;t spell the end of tantrums, but it did help me to reduce their frequency and intensity.  I hope that this resource is a help to you too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">_____________________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I used the following legend to keep notes in the Contributing Factors column.  Use these if they work for you, or feel free to invent your own.  I&#8217;d love your feedback on this.  Would you like to see the key included on the sheet???</p>
<p style="text-align: center">(F) = Food    (S) = Sick    (T) = Tired    (R) = Routine change    (P) = Parenting decision</p>

<p>I probably would have assumed this game was completely beyond her if it hadn&#8217;t naturally come out of what she was already doing.  First she drew a little basket that was on the craft table.  It was green with blue handles, and she didn&#8217;t do a bad job!  &#8220;Look Mummy!  Guess what I drew?&#8221; she said.  So I guessed a few random things around the house before guessing the basket, and then it was my turn.  &#8220;I spy with my little eye something that looks like this!&#8221;  The game was on.  I commentated as I drew to give her clues about colour, size and shape. It was possibly more entertaining for me than it was for her as she attempted to draw items from around the loungeroom.  Some looked more like the real thing than others (eg: the picture of her baby brother&#8217;s link rings &#8211; above).</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-768 alignright" title="img_5714" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/img_5714-300x225.jpg" alt="img_5714" width="240" height="180" />The game came to an abrupt halt though when I couldn&#8217;t work out this picture:</p>
<p>I should have know better than to play I Spy with a child whose world is <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/imaginary-menagerie/">cohabited by imaginary animals</a>.  As far as she was concerned the purple elephant in the room was fair game!</p>

<p>Isn&#8217;t it funny how kids can jump a whole clothing size in a week?  Or how you buy a pair of shoes for them one size up, put them in the cupboard, and by the time you get them out they are already too small?!  The rate at which children grow astounds me.</p>
<p>I guess I am still growing in some ways too.  Although I may not be getting any taller, I am certainly still growing as a mother.  And like my daughter, I think that perhaps I too am prone to growth spurts.  There are times when it seems like everything is smooth sailing with my parenting, and my kids and I are happily cruising along together.  Life isn&#8217;t perfect, but at least I have things mostly under control.  Then there are other times when I seem to be navigating through unchartered territory.  The learning curve is steep, and as the Mummy I&#8217;m required to be a fast learner in order to keep a step ahead of my kids.  It&#8217;s then that I trip over my own feet and land face first myself.  Ouch.</p>
<p>I think I need to be kind to myself.  It&#8217;s not like some transformation took place when I gave birth, endowing me with all the skills and knowledge I would need to successfully raise my kids to adulthood.  I think we are meant to grow with our kids, learning little by little what works (and doesn&#8217;t), tripping up occasionally and allowing the process to mature us.</p>
<p>One thing I have noticed with my daughter is that an awkward, clumsy patch is often followed by a delightful and contented phase.  She settles back into herself with a renewed confidence.  I hope that is true of me with my mummy growth spurts too.</p>

<p>We really use whatever we have in the kitchen at the time to make our shakes.  We start with a base of milk and fruit, and go from there!  Even if we add nothing else, whizzing up fruit and full cream milk in the blender makes frothy, yummy shakes that my toddler loves.</p>
<p>Berries are our favourite.  Partly because they taste great, and partly because my daughter just loves to watch the milk change colour in the blender.  Sometimes we add yoghurt to our berry shakes.  Bananas shakes are great too, especially with a scoop of icecream, a dash of honey and a little nutmeg.</p>
<p>Any tried and true milkshake combinations the kids in your house love?  Share them by leaving a comment below!</p>

<p>My little man has been out of sorts for almost a week.  He just hasn&#8217;t been his usually sociable and smiley self.  He&#8217;s been off his food, not napping well in the day, and waking several times through the night.  His low grade fever told me something was going on, but I just put it down to teething.  After all, most kids get a little hot and bothered when they start teething.</p>
<p>Today he was a picture of misery.  An overtired, inconsolable, feverish little boy.  So off we went to see our doctor, just in case I was wrong.</p>
<p>I was wrong. Poor kid no longer had a low grade temp, but a full blown fever thanks to a raging ear infection!  Our GP prescribed the  antibiotics his little body needed to fight the infection.  She couldn&#8217;t prescribe anything to fight my mummy-guilt.</p>
<p>Feeling like a lousy mother, I shared my thoughts with the twitterverse.  A friend replied soon after, reminding me of a truth I needed to hear.  She simply said, &#8220;<em>You didn&#8217;t give him the infection. You are fixing it.</em>&#8221;  Somehow that turned me around.  It wasn&#8217;t my fault.  I stopped beating myself up about the fact that I didn&#8217;t work out what the problem was sooner, and got on with the business of caring for my baby boy.</p>
<p>What would we do without other mums to support, encourage, and guide us?  I hope you have built a network of other mothers around you too (in the online world or the real one).  None of us can do this mothering adventure alone!</p>
<p>Gotta go&#8230; little man is awake.  Time for more infant paracetamol&#8230;!</p>

<p>1.  Dress your child in old clothes or put on a paint shirt (I do both!)</p>
<p>2.  Cover surfaces with a drop sheet or old newspapers.</p>
<p>3.  Use decent quality paint.  You need good depth of colour and good consistency.</p>
<p>4.  Limit the colours you put out.  We just use red/blue/yellow, because the primary colours all end up mixed and create secondary colours anyway.</p>
<p>5.  Use paint containers that are accessible for little fingers.  Try take-away food containers, shallow yoghurt tubs or even egg cartons.</p>
<p>6.  Remember the younger the child, the bigger the piece of paper they need!</p>
<p>7.  Show your child how to use their fingertips rather than their whole hand.  (Don&#8217;t be cross at them though when they go right ahead and stick their whole hand in the paint anyway!)</p>
<p>8.  Talk to your child while painting.  Rather than ask &#8220;What is it?&#8221; try asking &#8220;What are you thinking about while you&#8217;re painting?&#8221;  They <em>might</em> be thinking about an object, but they could also be thinking about an experience or an emotion, or they might just be thinking about how the paint feels on their fingers.</p>
<p>9.  Fill a large bowl with warm soapy water for cleaning hands at the end.</p>
<p>10.  Choose the best painting (or two) to put on display, and tell your child why you chose that picture.  It will encourage them the next time you do finger painting!</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-694" title="566616_75622404" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/566616_75622404-300x225.jpg" alt="566616_75622404" width="300" height="225" />I made a great dinner last night.   Lovely grilled ocean trout with wilted greens and a lime soy dressing served on a bed of rice.   Masterchef eat your heart out.   (Even my three year old scraped her plate clean!)   After enjoying our meal, my hubby and I put the kids to bed and cleaned up.   As usual I just tossed out the leftover rice because there wasn&#8217;t enough for another meal, and in all honesty I couldn&#8217;t be bothered coming up with something creative to do with the amount left.   I thought nothing of it and started opening the mail.   The first letter was from <a href="http://compassion.com.au">Compassion</a>, and it just about smacked me across the face.</p>
<p>It should have been a feel-good letter.  It was thanking us for a recent donation to assist with the current global food crisis.  But I didn&#8217;t feel good.  I felt guilty.  The letter opened with a quote from a mother in Nicaragua who said, &#8220;<em>Many blessings have come in moments when we most needed it, like someone showing up with rice&#8230;&#8221;</em> Yep, rice.  And I had just chucked our leftover rice out because I was lazy.</p>
<p>Right at that moment the world seemed horribly wrong to me.  How is it that one mother considers a cup of rice an answer to prayer, while another tosses it into the rubbish?  How is it that one family earns so little that they can&#8217;t feed their children a single simple meal, while another earns so much that they eat five times a day, every day?</p>
<p>Making the donation didn&#8217;t impact me, but the stark contrast between the way two mothers view rice did.  I was glad that I felt bad, if you know what I mean.  That unsettled, uncomfortable feeling is what makes us take action.  God trusted us with this world and I don&#8217;t know that we&#8217;ve done such a good job with it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m certain that the next time I cook rice for my family I&#8217;ll be thinking about that mum in Nicaragua.  I&#8217;ll talk to my daughter about the child we sponsor through Compassion, and about the way we can change the world one child at a time.  And when we say grace, we&#8217;ll pray for the kids with no rice and with empty tummies.  Maybe if we show our kids what&#8217;s wrong with the world, they&#8217;ll do a better job than we have of making things right.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-674" title="img_6229" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_6229-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6229" width="300" height="225" />I love this photo of my son and I blogging.   Well, I&#8217;m blogging and he&#8217;s giving me material to write about!   As children of a software developer and a reasonably tech-savvy mama, my kids are bound to be fairly technically literate and exposed to the online world from a young age.   But how young is too young?   Or is there no such thing, given that these kids are growing up as &#8220;digital natives&#8221;?</p>
<p>My son is 8mths old.   A laptop is certainly not a foreign item to him.   He knows that we touch the keys, but not the screen.   He knows that we use gentle fingers on the keys and do not hit them!   He is allowed to play with an old keyboard, but knows Mummy&#8217;s laptop is <em>not</em> for touching.</p>
<p>My daughter has just turned 3.   She regularly emails family and friends, with help from me.   She independently types her name and inserts smileys (shift key and all) and knows how to change the size and colour of the font in her text.  She knows what Google is.   She knows my online name is SquiggleMum (and has asked her father if he is &#8220;SquiggleDaddy&#8221;).   She knows what a blog is.   She knows how to get out of a program she has inadvertently opened by pressing esc.   She knows how to insert a CD and plug in a USB mouse.   She knows we use computers to find information, to communicate with people, to share photos, to watch video and to listen to music.  I didn&#8217;t know most of these things until I was well into my teens!</p>
<p>I want my kids to be able to function effectively in the world they find themselves growing up in &#8211; but as their Mum I also want to protect them.  I want to expose them to new technologies without exposing them to danger.  And that means I need to make some decisions, sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Will I let them have their own email addresses?  Will I let them post to their own blog?  Will I let them claim their own Twitter profile?  E-literate parents are already gently leading their little ones into the blogosphere, or the twitterverse, or whatever you want to call it.  A prominent Aussie blogger&#8217;s son, for example, has his own Twitter profile and almost two hundred followers.  He&#8217;s two and a half years old.  Too  young?  Maybe, maybe not.  He might have a significant following, but the only person he follows online is his Daddy.  Obviously his dad is watching out for him.</p>
<p>At the moment, I&#8217;m happy with my kids sending and receiving emails via my address, having their faces and stories (selectively chosen) on my blog, and not having a presence on Twitter or Facebook.  I guess I&#8217;ll have to keep reviewing that though.  Technologies change rapidly and children grow fast!  What have you decided about the amount you will expose your kids to the online world?  I&#8217;d love you to share your opinion &#8211; but please do it sensitively as we are talking about real people&#8217;s kids.</p>

<p>My daughter always seems ready to embrace the next stage in life long before I am.  She was on the go before I was ready for her to crawl.  She was walking before I had good shoes for her little feet.  She climbed out of the cot before we had bought a single bed for her to move to.  You get the idea.  Today my little munchkin turned three.  She&#8217;s ready.  I&#8217;m not.</p>
<p>Three is the end of being a toddler.  I just got used to saying I have a baby and a toddler.  What do I have now?  She&#8217;s not a kid yet.  She&#8217;s still little.  Three is still little!  She still needs help with a knife and fork.  She still needs help climbing out of the bathtub.  She still needs someone to do up her buttons, brush her teeth and tie her pigtails.  She&#8217;s still little!!!</p>
<p>I guess if she&#8217;s ok with being somewhere between a toddler and a kid, I should be ok with that too.  Really it&#8217;s a special time, because she&#8217;s <em>just</em> big enough to be independent, and <em>just </em>little enough to still need her Mummy.  And I have a feeling this phase won&#8217;t last long.   I only have the rest of this year with her at home before she&#8217;ll be off to kindy!</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s to Little Miss Three: my big little Mummy&#8217;s girl.  There&#8217;s a part of me that hopes she never completely grows up.</p>

		<p><em>My daughter turns three tomorrow, so I&#8217;m spending today doing the cake and getting things ready.  Thought I might <a href="http://www.scarymommy.com/flashback-friday-facebook-friends/">flashback</a> to this article I wrote in 2008 after her second birthday party.</em></p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-644" title="img_4332" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_4332-300x225.jpg" alt="img_4332" width="300" height="225" />Before becoming a mother I spent many years as a teacher.<span> </span>I planned excursions and celebrations and full scale musical productions.<span> </span>So I had no qualms about planning a little party for a two year old.<span> </span></p>
<p>I was quite pleased with my preparations.<span> </span>Low stress venue?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Age appropriate games?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Healthy but appetising morning tea?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>Party bags that parents would be as pleased to receive as their children?<span> </span>Check.<span> </span>The only thing I was slightly concerned about was the cake.</p>
<p>When I was growing up my mother had one of those Women’s Weekly cake books that everyone’s mum seemed to have.<span> </span>For a good two weeks leading up to a birthday my sister and I would pore over every picture as we tried to decide which cake would become the celebration’s centrepiece.<span> </span>A marshmallow Dolly Varden cake?<span> </span>Or a maypole cake with colourful ribbons and miniature dancing girls?<span> </span></p>
<p>With such fond childhood memories I looked forward to preparing a gorgeous butterfly cake for my own daughter’s birthday.<span> </span>That is, until the day before the party, when the realisation actually hit me.<span> </span>I think I had mistakenly come to the conclusion that cake decorating was a skill you automatically received during childbirth!<span> </span>You know, just one of those “mum things” that every mother is inherently capable of.<span> </span></p>
<p>I was starting to panic just a little when my sister rang to see how the party preparations were going.<span> </span>I told her nonchalantly that I only had the cake left to organise.<span> </span>My sister, who is far more competent in the kitchen than I am, cut straight through my pretence with a simple question.<span> </span>“What kind of icing are you using?” she asked.<span> </span>“You mean there’s more than one kind?!” I asked in return.<span> </span>As she laughed I said that sentence that I should say more often, even if it makes me cringe.<span> </span>“I think I need some help.”</p>
<p>My sister came over with creative ideas and beautiful cookbooks.<span> </span>(I noticed none of her books had bent pages or spilt ingredients on them but she doesn’t have children – yet.)<span> </span>Together we decided on a simple design, a basic icing, and a decorating plan of attack.<span> </span>Then she left me to it.<span> </span></p>
<div id="attachment_649" style="width: 220px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-649" title="img_4451" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_4451-300x225.jpg" alt="img_4451" width="210" height="158" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Flitter Flutter</p></div>
<p>That cake was a labour of love for me.<span> </span>And it turned out pretty well, if I do say so myself.<span> </span>It took pride of place in the middle of the table, but in all honesty it wasn’t the centrepiece of the celebration.<span> </span>My daughter was.<span> </span>She looked like a little fairy princess, and her smile told me that she felt like one too.<span> </span>I realised almost too late that she wasn’t impressed by my organisational skills or culinary efforts.<span> </span>She was just so happy to be with her little friends, to have two candles to blow out, and to have her mummy fluttering around in a pair of wings just like her!<span> </span>Everything else was just, well, icing on the cake…</p>
