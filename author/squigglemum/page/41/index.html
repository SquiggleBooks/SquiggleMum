		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-633" title="img_6241" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_6241-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6241" width="240" height="180" />One of my daughter&#8217;s little friends sent her a beautiful picture made with coloured salt.  Inspired by the lovely surprise in the post, we decided to give it a go too.  So easy, cheap and fun.  Here&#8217;s what we did:</p>
<p>Firstly, colouring the salt.  I bought a decent sized bag of no-name salt (for the grand sum of about 99c I think).  We poured some salt into a bowl, added a few drops of food colouring and stirred until the salt was evenly coloured.  Then we spread it out on a plate and nuked it for a minute or two in the microwave.  We put the salt aside to cool for a few minutes before transferring it to a craft container, and we repeated the process to make three different coloured batches.</p>
<p>On to creating!  This was an activity we mostly did together.  I drew simple outline shapes (butterflies, flowers, fish, etc) on paper with a dark marker.  We filled in sections of the picture with glue, then sprinkled on spoonfuls of salt.  We used one colour at a time and tipped the excess salt back into its container.<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-634" title="img_6412" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_6412-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6412" width="240" height="180" /></p>
<p>As my daughter got the hang of it she was able to do more of this craft on her own.  Her favourite part of the activity was seeing where the salt had stuck to the glue as we tipped off the excess.  We really enjoyed this activity together &#8211; and there wasn&#8217;t <em>that </em>much mess to clean up!</p>
<p>Have you tried this activity before?  Any tips to share&#8230;?</p>

		<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-624" title="rebecca_may" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/rebecca_may.jpg" alt="rebecca_may" width="242" height="346" />Meet the inspirational Rebecca Mason &#8211; <span>a wife, mother of 6 children (aged 6 wks to 10 yrs) and midwife living on the outskirts of Melbourne who has a passion for travelling and has a vision to inspire large families.  She is the founder of the <a href="http://www.familyvalue.com.au">Family Value </a>website which lists Aussie family attractions encourages them to bring back ‘Family Entry at Family Prices’.  Here are her five faves:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>1.  Favourite outing with kids</strong> &#8211; </span>Our favourite family outing is a trip to <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/melbournemuseum/">Melbourne Museum</a>, <a href="http://www.melbourneaquarium.com.au/">Melbourne Aquarium</a> &amp; <a href="http://museumvictoria.com.au/Scienceworks/">Scienceworks</a>.  All 3 attractions are excellent value, particularly the Museum with children gaining free entry.  Annual family memberships make for excellent family value.  All 3 attractions are also excellent for all ages and a full ‘relaxing’ day could easily be spent.  Apart from these attractions we love to take advantage of the free City of Melbourne seasonal events such as Moomba, the unveiling of the Christmas Advent Calendar &amp;  Myer Christmas Windows, as well as holiday activities.  We love these!  We also recently had an awesome time at the <a href="http://www.bendigoeasterfestival.org.au/">Annual Easter Festival</a> in Bendigo where most of the attractions were free and rides were only $2.</p>
<p><strong>2.  Favourite at-home activity with kids</strong> &#8211; Making things!  At our house we  love to create!  We have many ‘making books’ in the bookshelf and often have instant access to the internet where we can surf the web for creative projects to satisfy the moment!  From painting, drawing, making machines (with Dad), face painting, creating for future birthday parties (such as piñatas), and baking cakes &amp; muffins we attempt them all!  The odd performance concert is also a favourite with piano, clarinet, saxophone, recorders, dancing, music, acrobatics &amp; comedy sketches all a feature.  The concerts are recommended for ‘passing time’ for the children, however, I would recommend the audience has been ‘prepped’ with a cup of coffee (or 2 or 3!!).</p>
<p><strong>3.  Favourite family meal</strong> &#8211; Definitely ‘Flat Things’ or known to the rest of the world as Fajita Wraps.  We love ‘Flat Things’ because every member of the family can choose their own filling and it&#8217;s kind of healthy at the same time (depending on the fillings).  Not to mention it is the easiest meal to prepare!</p>
<p><strong>4.  Favourite bedtime stories</strong> &#8211; This changes from day to day, however, we do read bedtime stories every evening.  At the moment, <em>Happy Birth Day</em> and <em>Hi New Baby</em> (Robie H. Harris) are favourites with the younger kids and the older children are enjoying having <em>Superfudge</em> (Judy Blume) read to them every evening.  My kids can relate to these books as they are currently adjusting to a new baby in the house.  Our little one is only 6 weeks old!</p>
<p><strong>5.  Favourite way to wind down</strong>! &#8211; On the lounge with hubby in front of the TV with ‘secret takeaway’ from our local Greek Restaurant when the kids are in bed.  Of course funds don’t allow for the takeaway every evening so this is usually a fortnightly indulgence.  Surfing the web and lying down with a good book are also a treat!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">__________________________________________</p>
<p style="text-align: left">You can find out more about Rebecca&#8217;s gorgeous family by visiting her <a href="http://blog.familyvalue.com.au">blog</a>.  I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d love you to stop by and leave a comment.  Do you know of another inspiring mum I could feature next month..?</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-614" title="img_5511" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/img_5511-225x300.jpg" alt="img_5511" width="225" height="300" />It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day!  A day to celebrate motherhood.  A day to recognise the sacrifices women make in order to become mums.  A day to think about your mother.  A day to reflect on how your own kids came into the world.   A day to acknowledge that they have <em>changed </em>you.</p>
<p>Since becoming a mum, some changes have been harder to embrace than others.  My figure has changed &#8211; that gets me down sometimes.  My income has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s strange to work so hard at a job for zero pay!  My grocery list has changed &#8211; it&#8217;s now twice as long and includes milk that comes in 3L bottles.  My mornings have changed &#8211; anything past 7am now qualifies as a sleep in.  I could go on, but I know that focusing on the tough aspects of mothering doesn&#8217;t serve much of a useful purpose.  I might get a laugh out of it, but really it only makes me begrudge a choice I willingly and joyfully made.  I wanted to be a mum!  So this Mother&#8217;s Day, I&#8217;m going to focus on how my kids have changed me&#8230; for the better.</p>
<p>1.  My name has changed.  They call me Mummy and I love it.  (Ok, so my baby boy has only just started trying out a sound that vaguely resmembles mumumum&#8230;. but I&#8217;m counting it.)</p>
<p>2.  I&#8217;m more <a href="http://squigglemum.com/mums/waiting-game/">patient</a>.  If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog for a while you&#8217;ll know that this isn&#8217;t one of my strong suits.  My kids are constantly helping me in this area!</p>
<p>3. I appreciate me-time so much more.  Before becoming a mum I took this for granted.  I didn&#8217;t know what it meant to treasure time to myself, or time with a girlfriend, or time with my husband.</p>
<p>4. I&#8217;m less judgmental.    Oh how I&#8217;d love to take back some of the things I thought about other mothers, before I actually became one myself!</p>
<p>5.  My heart has changed.  I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happened.  It&#8217;s grown more sections or something.  I feel things I couldn&#8217;t feel before.  Sometimes my heart wants to break for my kids, and sometimes it wants to burst!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure all of these changes are permanent, and I&#8217;m glad.  I know my heart will never be the same again, and I hope that I keep growing in patience and working on my judgmental streak.  And one day, when I&#8217;m just &#8220;Mum&#8221; and not &#8220;Mummy&#8221; anymore, I hope I remember how it felt to have them look up at me and say my name.</p>
<p>How has becoming a mum changed you&#8230; for the better?</p>

<p>We took a trip to a nursery together and found Australian Native Violets (Viola hederacea) for only a couple of dollars.  A plant like this is perfect for planting with kids.  It&#8217;s small, has cute flowers, is easy to grow, spreads as a groundcover, and is happy in a pot or in the garden.  We chose to put ours in a pot on the front verandah.  My toddler was able to fill the pot with potting mix, tease the roots gently, put the plant in the hole, fill the dirt back in around it, and add pretty rocks.  She has diligently watered her violets every (yup, <strong>every</strong>) day since planting them, and they are absolutely thriving!</p>
<p>My children really are city kids, so I feel like these kinds of activities are especially important.  I want them to still understand about how things grow.  They need to know where flowers and fruits and vegetables come from.  I know they&#8217;ll learn about the parts of a plant and requirements for growth when they get to school, but I can teach them something else.  I can show them what it means to nurture something &#8211; to lovingly tend to it and care for it, and to take pride in the growth that results.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">________________________________________________</p>
<p>The Secret Garden (Frances Hodgson Burnett, (c) 1911) is one of my favourite books of all time.  Since I stole the title of this blog post from the book, I thought I&#8217;d share these snippets from Chapter XII:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Is there anything you want?&#8230; Do you want toys, books, dolls?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Might I,” quavered Mary, “might I have a bit of earth?”</em></p>
<p><em>In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound and that they were not the ones she had meant to say.   Mr. Craven looked quite startled.</em></p>
<p><em>“Earth!” he repeated.  “What do you mean?”</em></p>
<p><em>“To plant seeds in–to make things grow–to see them come alive,” Mary faltered.</em></p>
<p><em>Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room. “You can have as much earth as you want,” he said. &#8220;You remind me of some one else who loved the earth and things that grow.  When you see a bit of earth you want,&#8221; with something like a smile, “take it, child, and make it come alive.”</em></p>

<p>I am currently typing this article on my brand new shiny purple laptop because I had to sell my yellow car. Don’t quite follow? Read on&#8230;</p>
<p>It all came about because we are expecting our second child very soon. I always knew that my zippy little yellow hatchback wouldn’t cut it with two kids, and that I would eventually inherit my husband’s very sensible, very safe and practical silver sedan. I just didn’t expect to be so upset about the transition.</p>
<p>I don’t cry easily, even pregnant. So I caught my husband (and perhaps even myself) a little off guard when I cried a fountain of tears over saying goodbye to my little yellow car. It wasn’t that I desperately loved the vehicle. It was more that I loved what it represented. It was one of the last reminders of the girl I was in my pre-mum days. That car was a little piece of me on the road. Joyful, carefree, bold, with heaps of get-up-and-go. It was easy to drive and a dream to park. In my little fun-buggy I could go anywhere, do anything, and be completely independent. I felt like I was farewelling a part of myself as I farewelled my yellow car.</p>
<p>It seemed I had gone from having a colour-filled life to a life of grey. I cried my heart out and said to my husband, “I have your hand-me-down car, your hand-me-down computer and your mobile phone! There’s nothing left of ME anymore.” To his credit, my hubby was incredibly understanding. In fact he was the one who suggested the new laptop. Somehow he understood my need to retain a sense of self.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong – I love being a mum. It’s just that it’s important to me to remember who I am aside from being a mother. I will only be “Mummy” for a season. When my children one day grow up, and leave home, I don’t want to wonder who I am! So I need to keep some things in my life that remind me of who God created me to be. Joyful, carefree, bold, with heaps of get-up-and-go. Hence the shiny, purple laptop.</p>
<p>I use my computer daily. It’s my primary writing tool, my letter box, my 24hr help line and my link to the outside world. And I smile every time I use it because it’s so ME.</p>

<p>It started with a family of mice &#8211; completely out of the blue.  We hadn&#8217;t read any books about a mice, or seen anything on tv about mice or even talked about mice recently.  So where they came from, I have no idea.  From the moment they first &#8220;appeared&#8221; they were very tangible to my daughter.  She told me that there was a mummy mouse, daddy mouse, a girl mouse and a boy mouse (just like our family).  She told me what they were doing, where they were going, and how they were acting.  They scurried up her leg and travelled around on her shoulder.  They went to MOPS with us and to the shops with us.  She even asked the minister at church to hold them for her while she was busy doing a job!  (He very kindly went along with the whole debacle.)</p>
<p>I could probably deal with it if it stopped with the mice.  But oh no!  She now has imaginary animals all over the house.  If you&#8217;re not careful you might sit on pretend eggs from the pretend chooks.  And there are always &#8220;chocolate butterflies&#8221; flying around in our loungeroom.  If you are quick as one flits past, you can just pluck it out of the sky and gobble it up.  Quite the delicacy.  Are you starting to see why I might be concerned?!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time I&#8217;ve posted about my <a href="http://squigglemum.com/featured-articles/playing-pretend/">daughter&#8217;s imagination</a>, and it probably won&#8217;t be the last.  I&#8217;d love some feedback from other mums/moms.  Anyone else had experience with their kids having imaginary friends (or imaginary animals)?  Anyone like to comment on whether this is &#8220;normal&#8221; for an almost three-year-old, or a little quirky?  Should I stop worrying and just enjoy this phase while it lasts?!  Please leave me a comment.</p>

<p>Each month I&#8217;d like to share with you a <strong>Real Aussie Mum</strong>.  Despite the differences we all have as mothers, we can learn so much from each other just by sharing what works for us.  This month, meet Nicole from sunny Brisbane, Qld!  Before becoming a mum she was a teacher, and she has two kids:  Zoe is almost 3 and Riley is 7 months.  Here are her five faves:</p>
<p>1  <strong>Favourite outing with kids</strong> &#8211; a fortnightly trip into the city!  We catch a train in, play in a park, then head over to the library and museum.  The State Library (Qld) has a wonderful kids corner much like a playgroup with art, stories, kids yoga, music and more.  It changes all the time!  The Qld Museum has a wonderful dinosaurs area that just reopened.  Plus it has a huge whale and an aeroplane to wander under.  Then we have lunch and a play in the park at Southbank before hopping onto a CityCat (speedy river ferry).  We leave home at about 8:30am and get back any time between 2 and 4 in the afternoon.</p>
<p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt">2  <strong>Favourite at home activity with kids</strong> &#8211; Our favourite outside activity is the trampoline.  We all get on!  I sit with Riley while Zoe bounces.  It is an enclosed tramp so I fill it with balls from our ball pit.  Lots of fun!  Our favourite inside activity is getting lost in the playroom for hours at a time.  We dance, play music, read books, build with blocks, play playdough&#8230; You name it &#8211; it&#8217;s there!</p>
<p>3  <strong>Favourite family meal</strong> &#8211; We often eat <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/play-with-your-food-1-sausage-face/">funny faces</a> (ok, this is a must at least four nights a week)!  Our favourite meal to prepare for is take-out night.  We have a picnic on the family room floor, with a rug and plastic plates.  Zoe loves helping to dish up, and makes sure everyone has sauce, water, napkins, etc.  We love to cook chocolate brownies too, though I&#8217;m not sure they qualify as a meal&#8230;</p>
<p>4  <strong>Favourite bedtime story</strong> &#8211; Going On A Bear Hunt (by Michael Rosen).  Zoe can read it herself now, without looking at the words.  She loves acting it out with her bed friends and makes a cave under the covers.  Riley loves being a lion in the cave!</p>
<p>5  <strong>Favourite way to unwind!</strong> &#8211;  I don&#8217;t think I have unwound in three years!  I don&#8217;t have &#8220;just me&#8221; time, but I do enjoy sitting on my lounge swing out the back while I watch the kids play.  One day soon I will be able to have a cocktail on it while swinging.  I went from being pregnant to breast feeding, back to pregnant and more breastfeeding with about six weeks off in between!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve had a morning of <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/take-your-pick/">exploring your backyard</a> (or a local park) and collected a bunch of interesting things, what do you do with them all?!  Here are a few easy ideas your toddler will love:</p>
<p>1.  Make a collage.  My daughter never gets tired of sticking bits of bark, leaves, feathers and twigs onto cardboard.  Go figure.  It costs next to nothing, takes up a good chunk of time, and you end up with an artwork that generally looks pretty good!  PVA glue needed, so you&#8217;ll have to supervise this one closely.  Alternatively try a <a href="http://squigglemum.com/activities/a-week-with-playdough/">playdough collage</a>.</p>
<p>2.  Make patterns.  If you don&#8217;t have a whole lot to pick in your yard, this one might be for you.  Your toddler will need to collect several of two items.  Since the macadamia is a significant tree in our yard, we often collect nuts and leaves.  Show your toddler how to make a simple repeating pattern &#8211; leaf, nut, leaf, nut&#8230;</p>
<div id="attachment_544" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="size-medium wp-image-544" title="img_5877" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img_5877-300x225.jpg" alt="img_5877" width="300" height="225" /><p class="wp-caption-text">&quot;Look at my fairy garden Mummy!&quot;</p></div>
<p>3.  Make a ground picture.  Not all art has to be kept!  Another advantage of ground art is that you aren&#8217;t limited by the size of a page, or even the size of a table.  You can make huge pictures outside on the ground (but small ones are fine too).  Try making a person, or just a big face.  Try making a mini city and bring some cars outside to drive through it.  Or, like my day-dreamy daughter&#8230; make a fairy garden.</p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-503" title="img_6038" src="http://squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/img_6038-300x225.jpg" alt="img_6038" width="300" height="225" />It&#8217;s official.  Our little man is definitely crawling.  Occasionally he&#8217;s up on all fours, but mostly he is scooting around the floor in his own commando crawl style.  I had honestly forgotten what it was like to have a crawler in the house.  Admittedly, last time I had a crawler I didn&#8217;t also have a messy toddler.  So here are the first five things I did to accommodate a crawler in our home:</p>
<p>1.  Mopped the floor!  Ok, so I&#8217;m slack with this.  I sweep our wooden floor boards every day, but mopping is such a big job.  I aim to do it weekly.  I&#8217;m trying harder with that aim now.</p>
<p>2.  Got down on the floor with him and looked at the house from his eye level.  Oh boy.  How had I not noticed all those craft scraps, small toys and balls of fluff in the corners?!  Removed them all (though this needs doing again every morning before he sets off).</p>
<p>3.  Checked the safety gate on the stairs.  He&#8217;s getting faster every day.  How bad would I feel as a mum if my child took a tumble down the stairwell because I had neglected to check/shut the gate?</p>
<p>4.  Put together the playpen and gave it semi-permanent space in the living room.  I don&#8217;t use it all the time, but I find it incredibly useful.  I can separate baby and toddler if they are getting on each other&#8217;s nerves.  I can limit baby&#8217;s access to activities going on if he isn&#8217;t ready for them yet (eg playdough).  And importantly, I can put him somewhere safe so that I can go to the toilet!!!</p>
<p>5.  Got the camera out and took some happy snaps.  I can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s on the go already.  I suspect that I&#8217;ll blink again and he&#8217;ll be trying out those legs of his, and then he&#8217;ll really be off!  I sometimes have to remind myself to celebrate the stage my kids are in, regardless of whether they reach milestones earlier or later than I expected.  It was hard to get good photos though&#8230; he wouldn&#8217;t stay still!</p>
<p>Do you have a crawler in your home?  How do you deal with it?  Don&#8217;t be shy&#8230; leave a comment below!</p>

<p>We quietly snuggled and watched the horizon turn from orange to pink to purple.  I considered explaining why the sky was &#8220;coloured&#8221; and sharing some information about how the earth rotates, but in the end all I said was, &#8220;God did a good job, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;  My toddler smiled at me like I&#8217;d just worked out a secret that she knew all along.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why the bible says God has hidden things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children (Matt 11:25).  Unlike adults, young kids don&#8217;t need to find an explanation for everything that is beyond their understanding.  They are happy just to be awed by it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I was awed by God&#8217;s handiwork, but I wonder if that&#8217;s because I have become oblivious to the obvious.  Is God revealing himself to me all the time, and am I too busy to notice?  Has life become so hectic with two kids that I&#8217;ve forgotten to take the time to literally stop and smell roses, and credit the one who came up with the whole idea of flowers in the first place?</p>
<p>This week, I&#8217;m going to try to pay a little more attention.  When my daughter says (as she often does), &#8220;Come quick Mum!  Something&#8217;s awwwwesome!!!&#8221; I&#8217;m going to unbusy myself and check it out.  After all, she&#8217;s usually right.  Rainbows, caterpillars, stars and toadstools ARE awesome.</p>
