		<div class="entry-content">
		<p><em>The Boys Are Back</em> is a beautiful film shot in South Australia, starring Clive Owen and directed by Scott Hicks, director of Shine.  Inspired by a true story, it is the touching tale of a father who finds himself raising two sons alone while grieving the loss of his wife.  As he transitions from part time parent to full on father he learns a lot about his children, and perhaps even more about himself.</p>
<p>Would you like a night out at the movies?  I can&#8217;t organise baby sitting for you, but I do have TEN DOUBLE PASSES to giveaway thanks to <a href="http://twitter.com/HopscotchFilms">Hopscotch Films</a>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>The first ten SquiggleMum subscribers (new or existing, by email or RSS) to leave a comment below will win.<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p>Hopscotch were also kind enough to send Christie from <a href="http://childhood101.blogspot.com/">Childhood 101</a> and I tickets to catch the flick, and while we saw the film on opposite sides of the country we enjoyed chatting about it online.  Here are some of our thoughts reflecting on the film:</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: So was it what you expected?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I really enjoyed the fact that the movie explored parenting from a male perspective and the relationship between Dads and sons.  Though obviously it is just one perspective.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I enjoyed the Dad and boys perspective too. Especially in the light of having recently heard Steve Biddulph speak on raising boys, and the importance of the relationship between fathers and sons.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I found it really poignant when the Dad told his mother-in-law that his young son didn&#8217;t really know him, that they needed time to get to know each other and how to relate to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes, it made me wonder how many fathers would have to &#8220;get to know&#8221; their sons in the same situation.  And also made me wonder as a mum how I can facilitate my husband &#8220;knowing&#8221; my kids right now&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I think men generally relate differently to their children, and I think this generation of fathers especially have had a whole new set of expectations place upon them.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think this generation of fathers genuinely want to be Dads, want to spend time with their kids and want to be involved &#8211; but making it happen is hard.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: And society keeps pushing all of us to work longer and harder as members of the workforce which does not facilitate better family relationships in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: That was really highlighted in the movie: a dad pushed so hard at work that he chose to leave his kids overnight to save face with his employer.  No dad wants to be in that position.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Though wasn&#8217;t the older boy sweet and brave to offer to stay? I really felt for him when it all fell apart.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes &#8211; sweet and brave.  I hope I raise a boy who is sweet and brave, even if he doesn&#8217;t always get things right.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: So, how do we support our husbands to help them have the time and opportunity to be involved?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think we have to take a step back sometimes. As mums we can be control freaks!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: That is very true.  I think it is important for a child to have time one on one with each parent, as well as time together as a whole family.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I agree.  And while I absolutely think that parenting works best when both parents are on the same page, I think mums need to let dads do things their way without us criticising.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I also believe, it is about that being time truly being together too, not just watching the TV or doing chores around the home but having fun, laughing together, getting out and sharing unique experiences.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Getting the most out of whatever time you have together.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: That is right, creating memories with children.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: But I have to say&#8230; if the memory making involves dad driving on the beach with a child on the bonnet of the car, I&#8217;d probably step in there!! LOL</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Well, sometimes what Mum doesn&#8217;t know can&#8217;t hurt her! LOL!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: There was a scene in the movie where the kid was bomb diving into the spa bath. That was a memory making moment I would have missed as a mum, because I would have stepped in too soon, and worried about the mess.  Maybe sometimes a memory is worth the mess??</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I don&#8217;t think it was the mess that worried me, it was the chance of him hurting himself that had me grimacing!  But then, I am pretty tolerant of mess!  Fun mess, not domestic mess!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Did the flying fox in the movie make you grimace, or smile?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: No, I loved the flying fox. Those are the types of things I remember doing as a child.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Yes, me too.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I also appreciated the sense of space and freedom that the Dad provided his sons with.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Do you think the environment they were in contributed to that?  Is it harder to give our kids space and freedom in the city?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I think that can be an added pressure on city dads. They hear the negative stuff in the media and they shy away from giving freedom out of their desire to protect their family.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: Maybe, though not in our household, Immy has a lot more freedom and engages in a lot more &#8216;risky&#8217; behaviour with her Dad than she does when with me, obviously within the limits of her age but things like general proximity of parent to child and rough play, that type of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: My kids do engage in more adventurous behaviour in the backyard with Daddy too!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: You should see them at the pool, he bombies into the pool holding Immy, she loves it!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: As a kid I used to ride to the local milk bar, spend my pocket money on cheap lollies, ride back to the park, climb a tree and eat them. And Dad encouraged it! I&#8217;m not sure if my husband will encourage it in quite the same way, just because times have changed.  I guess we&#8217;ll see&#8230; I did learn to be quite responsible though. With freedom comes responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I am interested to know if the movie relate in any way to what Steve Biddulph shared in his presentation?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Steve Biddulph talks a lot about the stages of a boy&#8217;s development. From birth to around 5 he is all Mummy&#8217;s. Then he gets a surge of testosterone and becomes Daddy&#8217;s little shadow. This lasts right through to early teens, when he needs other male role models around. It was interesting watching the two sons in the two different phases.  Dads need to understand that the Mummy-phase will end, and they need to be ready for it!</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I wonder how you will feel when the Mummy-phase ends! LOL! WIll you be ready for it?</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: I hope so&#8230; but it will be a learning curve for me too!  Understanding the physiology helps. I know that right now the kind of love I can give will set him up for life, but he needs the different kind of love his dad can give him too in order to be a balanced man (one day). I can&#8217;t imagine how hard it is for mums who have to handle the daddy-phase on their own, or dads who have to cope with the mummy-phase&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: If parenting teaches you anything, it is that everything always changes!</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Too true, too true. So will you do anything differently, or view anything differently as a result of the flick?</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: I think it is all about balance. Balancing each role and recognising that both mother and father are equally important. And balancing expectations, there are times to relax and have fun but there is also much to be said for structure and routine.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: Absolutely, I completely agree with you there.</p>
<p><strong>Christie</strong>: And have as much fun together as you can, that is what families should be about.</p>
<p><strong>Cath</strong>: It was a very real movie. It reminded me that life is fragile, and that we all need to enjoy each stage of our family life &#8211; as husbands and wives, as parents, as a whole family.</p>

<p>Our wonderful builders have been here this week, fixing up some dodgy areas on our home.  We do a lot of renovating ourselves, but we know that some jobs are completely beyond us!  Little Miss 3 was fascinated with the builders&#8217; tool belts so we had a go at making one ourselves.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure if you google it you can find patterns for sewing proper child sized toolbelts, but toddlers aren&#8217;t great with waiting to see their ideas come to fruition, and besides &#8211; the process is always more important than the final product.  So to make our toolbelt we first rummaged through the recycling looking for small boxes.  Once we found a couple I trimmed them down to size.  We found some calico in the scrap material box and checked to see if it would be long enough to go around my daughter&#8217;s waist.  Then I carefully stapled the boxes onto the fabric and tied it on!</p>
<p>She found her own items to put into her toolbelt:  a few of her brother&#8217;s play tools, a small measuring tape, some allen keys, a spare door handle&#8230; then set off to do some hard yakka with the builders.  But when she got outside, my usually confident child went all shy!  LOL</p>

<p>Recently my son received these gorgeous home made beanie bags as a gift from a friend.  It was such a delightful present that I just had to share.  We have had so much fun with these together.  Here are ten of our favourite games to play with beanie bags:</p>
<ol>
<li>In and Out &#8211; very young ones enjoy the simple pleasure of putting things in and out of boxes and containers.  My 13mth old put the beanie bags in and out of a large plastic bowl, over and over again.</li>
<li>Beanie Toss &#8211; to step this up for toddlers, try throwing the beanie bags into the bowl.  Start by standing close, then step away as you achieve success!</li>
<li>Heads Up &#8211; little ones are entertained simply by watching you put a beanie bag on your head, or you placing one on theirs.  Toddlers can see how far they can walk with one on their own head &#8211; no helping hands!  (Or just pile &#8216;em up on Mum&#8230;)</li>
<li>Body Balance &#8211; where else can you balance a beanie bag?  On your foot?  Shoulder?  Elbow?  Knee?</li>
<li>Counting games &#8211; my three year old played lots of counting games with our numbered beanie bags.  Counting up to five, back from five, taking away one number and guessing which was missing&#8230;</li>
<li>Rainbows &#8211; our beanie bags are beautifully coloured so we were able to talk about colours and order our beanies according to the rainbow.  (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue at least)</li>
<li>Hide the Beanies &#8211; we had heaps of fun playing this game.  You can do it with any toys really, but the beanie bags were perfect.  One person counts while the other hides the beanie bags.  At first we just hid one, but after a while my daughter wanted to hide all of them!  Older kids still enjoy this too if you set a timer and they race to beat the clock.</li>
<li>Catching &#8211; catching an item in midair that is coming right for you is a BIG deal for a toddler.  It&#8217;s a skill that takes a while to develop.  Beanie bags are one of the easiest items to use for early catching and throwing practice.  We talked about keeping our eyes on the beanie and our hands ready.  Don&#8217;t be surprised if your child doesn&#8217;t get it straight away!</li>
<li>Shape and Colour &#8211; cut out some simple shapes from paper and put them on the floor.  See if your child can follow instructions to put a green beanie on the triangle.  A yellow beanie on the circle.  You can make it a challenge for older ones with instructions like: can you put a beanie that is NOT yellow on the shape with no straight sides&#8230;?  Oohh tricky.</li>
<li>Whack the Stack &#8211; stack five cups upside down.  Three on the bottom, then two on top.  Stand a few steps away and throw the beanies at the stack to knock them down.  Older toddlers will enjoy rebalancing the stack too.</li>
</ol>

		<p>I thought I&#8217;d revisit this old post from January, since it is featured in the current edition of Footprints Magazine.  You can <a href="http://www.facebook.com/inbox/?ref=mb#/pages/Footprints-magazine-for-Australian-Christian-women/105081061840">become a fan of Footprints on facebook</a> or <a href="http://footprintsaustralia.com/blog/">read their blog here</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1930" title="clean" src="http://www.squigglemum.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/clean.jpg" alt="clean" width="400" height="266" /></p>
<p>I had the most fabulous facial on the weekend. An hour to myself, uninterrupted by a needy baby or a demanding toddler. An hour of quiet bliss. I had not one, not two, but three exfoliations to get my skin glowing. As each mask was applied and then removed, I could almost feel the dirt, tiredness, stress and worry being lifted from my face. By the time it was over I looked better, felt better, and somehow sensed I was lighter than when I walked in.</p>
<p>My heart could sometimes use that kind of treatment. Like the pores on my skin, it&#8217;s easy for my heart to become clogged up too. Bitterness, cynicism, selfishness and jealousy sneak into my heart and weigh me down. They make me a duller version of the woman I know I can be.</p>
<p>Exfoliating my skin doesn&#8217;t come cheaply and takes a good hour, but exfoliating my heart only takes a few minutes. The Bible tells me that God can cleanse my heart, making it whiter than snow. (Psalm 51:7) All it takes it a genuine apology for the layers to be stripped away. And each time I do it I feel better, and brighter, and sense I am somehow lighter than before.</p>
<p>PS – thank you to that wonderful mum-friend who gave me the voucher for a facial as a birthday gift&#8230; everyone should have a friend like you.</p>

<p><em>&#8230;I often hear mothers who are pregnant the second time around say that they feel like no one has even noticed they are pregnant. I remember feeling exactly the same. My second pregnancy was no less special to me than my first. No less significant, or important or worthy of fuss. But it didn’t cause the same celebration and I found that hard to process&#8230;</em></p>

		<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-1914" title="slide2" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/slide2.jpg" alt="slide2" width="232" height="280" />We had a little, um, &#8220;incident&#8221; at an indoor play centre this week.</p>
<p>Accidents can happen easily at those centres, so before I let my three year old loose on the equipment I pointed out a few hazards to her.  In particular, I cautioned her about hanging too long at the bottom of the speedy slides.</p>
<p>As it turned out, <em>she </em>was the one who crashed into another child at the slide&#8217;s end.   The other child wasn&#8217;t hurt, but went off in tears to find her mother as children do.  I reassured my daughter that it was just an accident, but that she needed to go and apologise.  I sent her off to the teary child and watched from a short distance with my one year old.  But as I observed my daughter&#8217;s body language, a sinking feeling came over me.  She wasn&#8217;t apologising &#8211; she was scolding the other child!!</p>
<p>My daughter went off to play and I sheepishly approached the other mum, who was suitably unimpressed and confirmed my suspicions.  My daughter had told the other child she shouldn&#8217;t have been stopped at the bottom of the slide and she had better watch out next time or she&#8217;d be crashed into again.  *Sigh*  I went to find my daughter, then marched her back to apologise properly.  I was cross at my daughter and embarrassed for myself.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t cross about the accident.  In a way I knew that I couldn&#8217;t be too cross at my child for what she had said either, because she had only repeated what I had modelled to her.  I was just cross that instead of admitting her own part in the accident she pointed the finger of blame at someone else.</p>
<p>My daughter was unusually quiet in the car on the way home.  I was so busy processing all of this that it was a while before I noticed she hadn&#8217;t said anything.  <em>Not a word</em>.  I caught her reflection in the rearview mirror and realised that she was processing too &#8211; and she felt bad about it.  For a moment I wished I could take away that feeling.  Guilt sits so heavily in the pit of your stomach.  But taking away that feeling wouldn&#8217;t do her any favours.  Her little moral compass is just beginning to develop.  So we talked about it a bit more, said a prayer about it, and then I encouraged her to let it go.</p>
<p>I want her to know that an uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach usually means you&#8217;ve made a bad choice.  Perhaps as importantly, I want her to know that mistakes can be fixed, that we all live and learn, and that guilt doesn&#8217;t have to linger.</p>

<p style="text-align: left">I don&#8217;t think I knew how much toddlers ate, until I had one of my own.  Actually, now I have two of my own.  And the little one eats twice as much as the big one!!  They eat good, wholesome meals, but still they could snack all day.  Keeping healthy snacking options on hand is a challenge, and I admit that the bickie tin sometimes gets opened more than it should.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/380-eat-a-rainbow">Parenting Australia</a> this week I&#8217;m writing about steering our kids (and ourselves) away from &#8220;white&#8221; foods and towards colourful, healthy snacks.</p>
<p><em>Set up a surprise snack box for your child ahead of time. Either prepare it the night before, or get it ready in the morning while you’re doing the breakfast routine. Chop up anything from the fruit and veggie crisper of a single colour, put it in a small container and pop it into the fridge at a kid friendly height. That way, when your child gets the munchies you’ll have an alternative that’s just as easy as taking the lid off the barrel. Try a different coloured snack box for each day of the week. It’s a great way to make sure your child is getting a good range of different nutrients and an easy way of getting them to try new foods. It also has the added bonus of being an exciting surprise each day!</em></p>
<p>Head over to my post <a href="http://parentingaustralia.com.au/blog/380-eat-a-rainbow">Eat A Rainbow</a> for suggestions on what to put into your coloured snack boxes&#8230;</p>

		<p>Children learn so much from stories.  I love the way they take details from books that adults would likely skim over,and apply it to their world.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1875" title="peter1" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/peter1-289x300.jpg" alt="peter1" width="289" height="300" /></p>
<p>I remember one night a few months ago my three year old came forlornly out of her bedroom at night and asked for some parsley.  My husband looked at me with raised eyebrows while my brain scrambled to make sense of my child&#8217;s request.  A light bulb flicked on in my mind as I recalled one of our favourite stories &#8211; <em>The Tale of Peter Rabbit</em>.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with the story (I know, I know&#8230; but just in case) Peter Rabbit overindulges himself in Mr Macgregor&#8217;s garden and ends up with a stomach ache.  To ease his discomfort he seeks out some parsley!</p>
<p>Having made the connection, I asked my daughter if she had a sore tummy, which she did.  I had to explain that parsley wouldn&#8217;t work as well for a little girl as it would a little rabbit, but some infant Panadol did the job!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1876" title="caterpillar1" src="http://128.199.155.214/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/caterpillar1-294x300.jpg" alt="caterpillar1" width="294" height="300" /></p>
<p>Then on Friday morning we were reading<em> The Very Hungry Caterpillar</em>, which is also read often in our house.  When we finished it  my daughter said, &#8220;Mummy, caterpillars eat a juicy green leaf when they have a tummy ache.  And rabbits eat a parsley leaf.  What kind of leaf do people eat to fix a tummy ache?&#8221;</p>
<p>An excellent question.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I had an appointment with my GP only a couple of hours later.  Even more fortunately, she is excellent with children.  She humoured us both &#8211; listening intently to my daughter&#8217;s very serious question, and giving  her a sensible answer to satisfy her three year old curiosity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phew!</strong></em></p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading my blog for a while, you&#8217;ll know that Little Miss Three  has a vivid imagination.  She loves make believe games, and has more than one or two <a href="../../../../index.html%3Fp=553.html">imaginary little friends</a>.  So I wasn&#8217;t surprised that she asked this question at breakfast.  Since a few mums have asked me how to explain God to kids, I thought you&#8217;d like to eavesdrop on our conversation.  It went something like this:</p>
<p>LM3:  Mummy, my fairies are having breakfast on the table today.</p>
<p>Me:  That&#8217;s nice.  I hope they are eating up all their cereal.</p>
<p>LM3:  Yep, but it&#8217;s just pretend cereal.</p>
<p>Me:  (laugh) Of course.</p>
<p>LM3: (Pause&#8230;)  Mummy, is God pretend?</p>
<p>Me:  That&#8217;s a good question you know.  God&#8217;s not pretend, like your fairies.  We can&#8217;t see your fairies, because we just imagine them.  God is different.  We can&#8217;t see Him, but He&#8217;s real.  (<em>Brain kicking into overdrive as I try to come up with a toddler-friendly way of explaining this&#8230; am thankful that the trees catch my eye outside</em>).  Look out the window.  It&#8217;s a windy day today, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>LM3:  Uh huh.</p>
<p>Me:  Can you see the wind?</p>
<p>LM3:  Yes!</p>
<p>Me:  Are you sure?  I can&#8217;t see the wind.  I can just see trees!  I can see branches bending and leaves swishing and swaying, but I can&#8217;t actually see the wind.  Can you REALLY see the wind?</p>
<p>LM3:  Nope.  I can just see leaves dancing in the wind.</p>
<p>Me:  We can&#8217;t see the wind, but we know it&#8217;s there because we can see things moving around in it.  That&#8217;s a bit like God.  We can&#8217;t see Him, but we know He&#8217;s there because we see how He works.</p>
<p>LM3:  (just taking it in&#8230;)  It might be a good kite day Mummy.</p>
<p>Me:  (laugh)  Yes, but not until that cereal is finished&#8230;</p>
